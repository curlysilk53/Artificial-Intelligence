 = Du Fu = 
 
 Du Fu ( Wade – Giles : Tu Fu ; Chinese : <unk> ; <unk> – 770 ) was a prominent Chinese poet of the Tang dynasty . Along with Li <unk> ( Li Po ) , he is frequently called the greatest of the Chinese poets . His greatest ambition was to serve his country as a successful civil servant , but he proved unable to make the necessary accommodations . His life , like the whole country , was devastated by the An <unk> Rebellion of <unk> , and his last 15 years were a time of almost constant unrest . 
 Although initially he was little @-@ known to other writers , his works came to be hugely influential in both Chinese and Japanese literary culture . Of his poetic writing , nearly fifteen hundred poems have been preserved over the ages . He has been called the " Poet @-@ Historian " and the " Poet @-@ Sage " by Chinese critics , while the range of his work has allowed him to be introduced to Western readers as " the Chinese Virgil , Horace , <unk> , Shakespeare , Milton , Burns , <unk> , <unk> , Hugo or <unk> " . 
 
 = = Life = = 
 
 Traditional Chinese literary criticism emphasized the life of the author when interpreting a work , a practice which Burton Watson attributes to " the close links that traditional Chinese thought posits between art and morality " . Since many of Du Fu 's poems feature morality and history , this practice is particularly important . Another reason , identified by the Chinese historian William <unk> , is that Chinese poems are typically <unk> , <unk> context that might be relevant , but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know . For modern Western readers , " The less accurately we know the time , the place and the circumstances in the background , the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly , and the result will be that we either <unk> the poem or fail to understand it altogether " . Stephen Owen suggests a third factor particular to Du Fu , arguing that the variety of the poet 's work required consideration of his whole life , rather than the " <unk> " <unk> used for more limited poets . 
 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 
 Most of what is known of Du Fu 's life comes from his poems . His paternal grandfather was Du <unk> , a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu . Du Fu was born in <unk> ; the exact birthplace is unknown , except that it was near Luoyang , Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ) . In later life , he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an , ancestral hometown of the Du family . 
 Du Fu 's mother died shortly after he was born , and he was partially raised by his aunt . He had an elder brother , who died young . He also had three half brothers and one half sister , to whom he frequently refers in his poems , although he never mentions his stepmother . 
 The son of a minor scholar @-@ official , his youth was spent on the standard education of a future civil servant : study and <unk> of the Confucian classics of philosophy , history and poetry . He later claimed to have produced <unk> poems by his early teens , but these have been lost . 
 In the early <unk> , he travelled in the <unk> / Zhejiang area ; his earliest surviving poem , describing a poetry contest , is thought to date from the end of this period , around 735 . In that year , he took the civil service exam , likely in Chang 'an . He failed , to his surprise and that of centuries of later critics . <unk> concludes that he probably failed because his prose style at the time was too dense and obscure , while Chou suggests his failure to <unk> connections in the capital may have been to blame . After this failure , he went back to traveling , this time around Shandong and Hebei . 
 His father died around 740 . Du Fu would have been allowed to enter the civil service because of his father 's rank , but he is thought to have given up the privilege in favour of one of his half brothers . He spent the next four years living in the Luoyang area , fulfilling his duties in domestic affairs . 
 In the autumn of <unk> , he met Li <unk> ( Li Po ) for the first time , and the two poets formed a friendship . David Young describes this as " the most significant formative element in Du Fu 's artistic development " because it gave him a living example of the reclusive poet @-@ scholar life to which he was attracted after his failure in the civil service exam . The relationship was somewhat one @-@ sided , however . Du Fu was by some years the younger , while Li <unk> was already a poetic star . We have twelve poems to or about Li <unk> from the younger poet , but only one in the other direction . They met again only once , in <unk> . 
 In 746 , he moved to the capital in an attempt to resurrect his official career . He took the civil service exam a second time during the following year , but all the candidates were failed by the prime minister ( apparently in order to prevent the emergence of possible rivals ) . He never again attempted the examinations , instead <unk> the emperor directly in <unk> , 754 and probably again in <unk> . He married around <unk> , and by <unk> the couple had had five children — three sons and two daughters — but one of the sons died in infancy in <unk> . From 754 he began to have lung problems ( probably asthma ) , the first of a series of <unk> which <unk> him for the rest of his life . It was in that year that Du Fu was forced to move his family due to the turmoil of a famine brought about by massive floods in the region . 
 In <unk> , he received an appointment as <unk> of the Right Commandant 's office of the Crown Prince 's Palace . Although this was a minor post , in normal times it would have been at least the start of an official career . Even before he had begun work , however , the position was swept away by events . 
 
 = = = War = = = 
 
 The An <unk> Rebellion began in December <unk> , and was not completely suppressed for almost eight years . It caused enormous disruption to Chinese society : the census of 754 recorded 52 @.@ 9 million people , but ten years later , the census counted just 16 @.@ 9 million , the remainder having been displaced or killed . During this time , Du Fu led a largely itinerant life <unk> by wars , associated <unk> and imperial <unk> . This period of <unk> was the making of Du Fu as a poet : Even Shan Chou has written that , " What he saw around him — the lives of his family , neighbors , and strangers – what he heard , and what he hoped for or feared from the progress of various campaigns — these became the enduring themes of his poetry " . Even when he learned of the death of his youngest child , he turned to the suffering of others in his poetry instead of dwelling upon his own <unk> . Du Fu wrote : 
 <unk> on what I have lived through , if even I know such suffering , the common man must surely be <unk> by the winds . 
 In <unk> , Emperor <unk> was forced to flee the capital and <unk> . Du Fu , who had been away from the city , took his family to a place of safety and attempted to join the court of the new emperor ( <unk> ) , but he was captured by the rebels and taken to Chang 'an . In the autumn , his youngest son , Du <unk> ( Baby Bear ) , was born . Around this time Du Fu is thought to have contracted malaria . 
 He escaped from Chang 'an the following year , and was appointed <unk> when he rejoined the court in May <unk> . This post gave access to the emperor but was largely ceremonial . Du Fu 's <unk> compelled him to try to make use of it : he caused trouble for himself by protesting the removal of his friend and patron Fang Guan on a petty charge . He was arrested but was <unk> in June . He was granted leave to visit his family in September , but he soon rejoined the court and on December 8 , <unk> , he returned to Chang 'an with the emperor following its recapture by government forces . However , his advice continued to be <unk> , and in the summer of <unk> he was demoted to a post as Commissioner of Education in <unk> . The position was not to his taste : in one poem , he wrote : 
 I am about to scream <unk> in the office / Especially when they bring more papers to pile higher on my desk . 
 He moved on in the summer of <unk> ; this has traditionally been ascribed to famine , but <unk> believes that frustration is a more likely reason . He next spent around six weeks in <unk> ( now <unk> , Gansu province ) , where he wrote more than sixty poems . 
 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 
 In December <unk> , he briefly stayed in <unk> ( modern Gansu ) . He departed on December 24 for <unk> ( Sichuan province ) , where he was hosted by local <unk> and fellow poet <unk> Di . Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years . By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble , and sent poems <unk> help to various acquaintances . He was relieved by Yan Wu , a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at <unk> . Despite his financial problems , this was one of the <unk> and most peaceful periods of his life . Many of Du 's poems from this period are peaceful depictions of his life at " <unk> <unk> " . In 762 , he left the city to escape a rebellion , but he returned in summer <unk> when he was appointed an advisor to Yan , who was involved in campaigns against the <unk> Empire .

 Luoyang , the region of his birthplace , was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762 , and in the spring of <unk> Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze , apparently with the intention of making their way there . They traveled slowly , held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight , <unk> and general old age in addition to his previous <unk> ) . They stayed in <unk> ( in what is now <unk> , <unk> ) at the entrance to the Three <unk> for almost two years from late spring <unk> . This period was Du Fu 's last great poetic flowering , and here he wrote 400 poems in his dense , late style . In autumn <unk> , Bo <unk> became governor of the region : he supported Du Fu financially and employed him as his unofficial secretary . 
 In March <unk> , he began his journey again and got as far as <unk> province , where he died in <unk> ( now <unk> ) in November or December 770 , in his <unk> year . He was survived by his wife and two sons , who remained in the area for some years at least . His last known descendant is a grandson who requested a grave inscription for the poet from Yuan <unk> in <unk> . 
 <unk> <unk> his life by concluding that , " He appeared to be a <unk> son , an affectionate father , a generous brother , a faithful husband , a loyal friend , a <unk> official , and a patriotic subject . " 
 Below is an example of one of Du Fu 's later works , To My <unk> Friend <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ) . Like many other poems in the Tang it featured the theme of a long parting between friends , which was often due to officials being frequently transferred to the provinces :

 Criticism of Du Fu 's works has focused on his strong sense of history , his moral engagement , and his technical excellence . 
 
 = = = History = = = 
 
 Since the Song dynasty , critics have called Du Fu the " poet historian " ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . The most directly historical of his poems are those commenting on military tactics or the successes and failures of the government , or the poems of advice which he wrote to the emperor . <unk> , he wrote about the effect of the times in which he lived on himself , and on the ordinary people of China . As Watson notes , this is information " of a kind seldom found in the officially compiled histories of the era " . 
 Du Fu 's political comments are based on emotion rather than calculation : his <unk> have been <unk> as , " Let us all be less selfish , let us all do what we are supposed to do " . Since his views were impossible to disagree with , his <unk> expressed <unk> enabled his installation as the central figure of Chinese poetic history . 
 
 = = = <unk> engagement = = = 
 
 A second favourite epithet of Chinese critics is that of " poet sage " ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , a counterpart to the philosophical sage , <unk> . One of the earliest surviving works , The Song of the <unk> ( from around 750 ) , gives voice to the <unk> of a <unk> soldier in the imperial army and a clear @-@ sighted consciousness of suffering . These concerns are continuously articulated in poems on the lives of both soldiers and civilians produced by Du Fu throughout his life . 
 Although Du Fu 's frequent references to his own difficulties can give the impression of an all @-@ consuming <unk> , Hawkes argues that his " famous compassion in fact includes himself , viewed quite <unk> and almost as an <unk> " . He therefore " lends grandeur " to the wider picture by comparing it to " his own slightly comical triviality " . 
 Du Fu 's compassion , for himself and for others , was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry : he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment . Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu , " everything in this world is poetry " , Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life , calligraphy , paintings , animals , and other poems . 
 
 = = = Technical excellence = = = 
 
 Du Fu 's work is notable above all for its range . Chinese critics traditionally used the term <unk> ( <unk> " complete <unk> " ) , a reference to <unk> ' description of <unk> . Yuan <unk> was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu 's achievement , writing in <unk> that his predecessor , " united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly " . He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he " either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples " . Furthermore , his poems use a wide range of registers , from the direct and <unk> to the <unk> and self @-@ consciously literary . This variety is <unk> even within individual works : Owen identifies the , " rapid stylistic and thematic shifts " in poems which enable the poet to represent different <unk> of a situation , while Chou uses the term " juxtaposition " as the major analytical tool in her work . Du Fu is noted for having written more on <unk> and painting than any other writer of his time . He wrote eighteen poems on painting alone , more than any other Tang poet . Du Fu 's seemingly negative commentary on the prized horse paintings of Han <unk> <unk> a controversy that has persisted to the present day . 
 The tenor of his work changed as he developed his style and adapted to his surroundings ( " <unk> @-@ like " according to Watson ) : his earliest works are in a relatively derivative , courtly style , but he came into his own in the years of the rebellion . Owen comments on the " <unk> simplicity " of the <unk> poems , which mirrors the desert landscape ; the works from his <unk> period are " light , often finely observed " ; while the poems from the late <unk> period have a " density and power of vision " . 
 Although he wrote in all poetic forms , Du Fu is best known for his <unk> , a type of poem with strict constraints on form and content , for example : 
 About two thirds of Du Fu 's 1500 extant works are in this form , and he is generally considered to be its leading exponent . His best <unk> use the <unk> required by the form to add expressive content rather than as mere technical restrictions . Hawkes comments that , " it is amazing that Tu Fu is able to use so immensely stylized a form in so natural a manner " . 
 
 = = Influence = = 
 
 According to the <unk> Britannica , Du Fu 's writings are considered by many literary critics to be among the greatest of all time , and it states " his dense , compressed language makes use of all the <unk> overtones of a phrase and of all the <unk> <unk> of the individual word , qualities that no translation can ever reveal . " 
 In his lifetime and immediately following his death , Du Fu was not greatly appreciated . In part this can be attributed to his stylistic and formal innovations , some of which are still " considered extremely daring and bizarre by Chinese critics . " There are few contemporary references to him — only eleven poems from six writers — and these describe him in terms of affection , but not as a <unk> of poetic or moral ideals . Du Fu is also poorly represented in contemporary anthologies of poetry . 
 However , as <unk> notes , he " is the only Chinese poet whose influence grew with time " , and his works began to increase in popularity in the ninth century . Early positive comments came from <unk> <unk> , who praised the moral sentiments of some of Du Fu 's works ( although he found these in only a small fraction of the poems ) , and from Han Yu , who wrote a piece defending Du Fu and Li <unk> on aesthetic grounds from attacks made against them . Both these writers showed the influence of Du Fu in their own poetic work . By the beginning of the 10th century , <unk> <unk> constructed the first replica of his <unk> cottage in Sichuan . 
 It was in the 11th century , during the Northern Song era that Du Fu 's reputation reached its peak . In this period a comprehensive re @-@ evaluation of earlier poets took place , in which Wang <unk> , Li <unk> and Du Fu came to be regarded as representing respectively the Buddhist , <unk> and Confucian strands of Chinese culture . At the same time , the development of Neo @-@ <unk> ensured that Du Fu , as its poetic <unk> , occupied the paramount position . Su Shi famously expressed this reasoning when he wrote that Du Fu was " <unk> ... because ... through all his <unk> , he never for the space of a meal <unk> his sovereign " . His influence was helped by his ability to reconcile apparent opposites : political <unk> were attracted by his loyalty to the established order , while political radicals embraced his concern for the poor . Literary <unk> could look to his technical mastery , while literary radicals were inspired by his innovations . Since the establishment of the People 's Republic of China , Du Fu 's loyalty to the state and concern for the poor have been interpreted as embryonic nationalism and socialism , and he has been praised for his use of simple , " people 's language " . 
 Du Fu 's popularity grew to such an extent that it is as hard to measure his influence as that of Shakespeare in England : it was hard for any Chinese poet not to be influenced by him . While there was never another Du Fu , individual poets followed in the traditions of specific aspects of his work : <unk> <unk> 's concern for the poor , Lu You 's patriotism , and <unk> <unk> 's <unk> on the <unk> are a few examples . More broadly , Du Fu 's work in transforming the <unk> from mere word play into " a vehicle for serious poetic <unk> " set the stage for every subsequent writer in the genre . 
 In the 20th century , he was the favourite poet of Kenneth <unk> , who has described him as " the greatest non @-@ epic , non @-@ dramatic poet who has survived in any language " , and commented that , " he has made me a better man , as a moral agent and as a <unk> organism " . 
 
 = = = Influence on Japanese literature = = = 
 
 Du Fu 's poetry has made a profound impact on Japanese literature , especially on the literature from the <unk> period and on scholars and poets in the Edo period , including <unk> <unk> , the very greatest of all <unk> poets . Even in modern Japanese , the term Saint of Poetry ( <unk> , <unk> ) is mostly synonymous with Du Fu . 
 Until the 13th century , the Japanese preferred <unk> <unk> above all poets and there were few references to Du Fu , although his influence can be seen in some <unk> ( " Chinese poetry made by Japanese poets " ) anthologies such as <unk> <unk> in the 9th century . The first notable Japanese <unk> of Du Fu 's poetry was <unk> <unk> ( <unk> – <unk> ) , a <unk> <unk> patriarch and one of the most prominent authors of the literature of the Five Mountains ; he highly praised Du Fu and made a commentary on some poems of Du Fu from the perspective of a <unk> priest in Vol . 11 of <unk> . His student <unk> <unk> composed many <unk> which were clearly stated " influenced by Du Fu " in their <unk> . <unk> 's student <unk> <unk> had close connection with the Court and <unk> <unk> and <unk> Du Fu 's poetry in the mundane world ; one day <unk> <unk> , the <unk> regent of the Court and the highest authority of <unk> poetry , asked <unk> , " Should I learn the poetry of Du Fu and Li <unk> ? " <unk> <unk> to reply , " Yes if you do have enough capability . No if do not . " Since then , there had been many <unk> on Du Fu 's poetry both in <unk> temples and in the aristocratic society , and as a result his poetry was often cited in Japanese literature in the <unk> period , e.g. , <unk> , a historical epic in the late 14th century , and some <unk> plays such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 During the Kan <unk> era of the Edo period ( 1624 – 1643 ) , <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) of the Ming Dynasty 's <unk> <unk> on Du Fu 's <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) was imported into Japan , and it gained explosive popularity in Confucian scholars and <unk> ( <unk> ) class . The commentary established Du Fu 's fame as the highest of all poets ; for instance , <unk> <unk> , a notable Confucian scholar , commented in Vol . 37 of <unk> <unk> that <unk> [ Du Fu ] was the very best poet in history and praised <unk> <unk> 's commentary for its simplicity and readability , while he criticized old commentaries during the Yuan Dynasty were too <unk> . <unk> <unk> , the greatest <unk> poet , was also strongly influenced by Du Fu ; in <unk> no <unk> , his masterpiece , he cites the first two lines of A Spring View ( <unk> ) before a <unk> as its introduction and also many of his other <unk> have similar wording and themes . It is said that when he died in Osaka during a long travel , a copy of Du Fu 's poetry was found with him as one of a few precious items which he was able to carry around .

 A variety of styles have been used in efforts to translate Du Fu 's work into English . As Burton Watson remarks in The Selected Poems of Du Fu , " There are many different ways to approach the problems involved in translating Du Fu , which is why we need as many different translations as possible " ( <unk> <unk> ) . The translators have had to contend with bringing out the formal constraints of the original without sounding <unk> to a Western ear ( particularly when translating regulated verse , or <unk> ) , and <unk> the complex allusions contained particularly in the later works ( Hawkes writes that " his poems do not as a rule come through very well in translation " — <unk> <unk> ) . One extreme on each issue is represented by Kenneth <unk> 's One Hundred Poems From the Chinese . His are free translations , which seek to conceal the <unk> through <unk> and expansion and contraction of the content ; his responses to the allusions are firstly to <unk> most of these poems from his selection , and <unk> to " translate out " the references in those works which he does select . 
 Other translators have placed much greater weight on trying to convey a sense of the poetic forms used by Du Fu . Vikram Seth in Three Chinese Poets uses English @-@ style rhyme schemes , whereas Keith <unk> in Facing the Moon <unk> the Chinese rhyme scheme ; both use end @-@ stopped lines and preserve some degree of <unk> . In The Selected Poems of Du Fu , Burton Watson follows the <unk> quite strictly , persuading the western reader to adapt to the poems rather than vice versa . Similarly , he deals with the allusion of the later works by combining literal translation with extensive <unk> . 
 In 2015 , Stephen Owen published translations , with facing Chinese texts , of the complete poetry of Du Fu in six volumes , with extensive scholarly apparatus , which emphasized <unk> .

The lyrical content regards the protagonist 's infatuation with a significant other , and incorporates <unk> for sexual intercourse in the lines " If you don ’ t wanna take it slow / And you just wanna take me home / Baby say yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . " 
 " Kiss You " was well received by contemporary music critics , who centred on its quality of production . Both Rolling Stone 's Jon Dolan , who praised its effectiveness , and Chris Payne of Billboard , who appreciated the melody , described " Kiss You " as one of the album 's highlights . Alexis <unk> for The Guardian commended the track 's chorus as " hard to <unk> from your brain " . Robert Copsey of Digital Spy noted the song 's possibility to become an international hit , <unk> it <unk> . A reviewer for MTV News described the track 's <unk> as " butterflies @-@ inducing " , and Sam <unk> of Idolator wrote that " Kiss You " is noticeably a stand @-@ out track on its parent album . Melinda Newman , writing for HitFix , regarded the song as " a <unk> , electronic infectious ditty , " while Chris <unk> , a critic from <unk> , deemed it an " amazing pop song " , lauding the group 's falsetto and its " head @-@ <unk> <unk> " chorus .

 The <unk> @-@ class battleships ( <unk> , <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> ) were a pair of dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( <unk> ) during World War I. Originally intended to be repeats of the preceding <unk> class , they were redesigned before construction began . Both ships carried supplies for the survivors of the Great <unk> earthquake in 1923 . They were modernized in 1934 – 37 with improvements to their armour and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style . Afterwards they played a minor role in the Second <unk> @-@ Japanese War . 
 Despite the expensive reconstructions , both vessels were considered obsolete by the eve of the Pacific War , and neither saw significant action in the early years of the war . Following the loss of most of the <unk> 's large aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in mid @-@ 1942 , they were rebuilt with a flight deck replacing the rear pair of gun turrets to give them the ability to operate an air group of <unk> . A lack of aircraft and qualified pilots , however , meant that they never actually operated their aircraft in combat . While awaiting their air group the sister ships were sometimes used to ferry troops and material to Japanese bases . They participated in the Battle of Cape <unk> in late 1944 , where they <unk> the American carrier fleet supporting the invasion of <unk> away from the landing beaches . Afterwards both ships were transferred to Southeast Asia ; in early 1945 they participated in Operation <unk> , where they transported petrol and other strategic materials to Japan . The sisters were then reduced to reserve until they were sunk during American airstrikes in July . After the war they were scrapped in 1946 – 47 . 
 
 = = Background = = 
 
 The design of the <unk> @-@ class battleships was shaped both by the ongoing international naval arms race and a desire among Japanese naval planners to maintain a fleet of capital ships powerful enough to defeat the United States Navy in an encounter in Japanese territorial waters . The <unk> 's fleet of battleships had proven highly successful in 1905 , the last year of the Russo @-@ Japanese War , which culminated in the destruction of the Russian Second and Third Pacific Squadrons at the Battle of <unk> . 
 In the aftermath , the Japanese Empire immediately turned its focus to the two remaining rivals for imperial dominance in the Pacific Ocean : Britain and the United States . <unk> <unk> , a Japanese Navy admiral and military theorist , speculated that conflict would inevitably arise between Japan and at least one of its two main rivals . To that end , he called for the Japanese Navy to maintain a fleet with at least 70 % as many capital ships as the US Navy . This ratio , <unk> theorized , would enable the Imperial Japanese Navy to defeat the US Navy in one major battle in Japanese waters in any eventual conflict . Accordingly , the 1907 Imperial Defence Policy called for the construction of a battle fleet of eight modern battleships , 20 @,@ 000 long tons ( 20 @,@ 321 t ) each , and eight modern armoured cruisers , 18 @,@ 000 long tons ( 18 @,@ <unk> t ) each . This was the genesis of the Eight @-@ Eight Fleet Program , the development of a cohesive battle line of sixteen capital ships . 
 The launch of HMS <unk> in 1906 by the Royal Navy raised the stakes , and complicated Japan 's plans . <unk> 17 @,@ 900 long tons ( 18 @,@ 200 t ) and armed with ten 12 @-@ inch ( 30 @.@ 5 cm ) guns , <unk> rendered all existing battleships obsolete by comparison . The launch of the battlecruiser HMS Invincible the following year was a further setback for Japan 's quest for parity . When the two new <unk> @-@ class battleships and two <unk> @-@ class armoured cruisers , launched by 1911 , were <unk> by their British counterparts , the Eight @-@ Eight Fleet Program was <unk> . 
 The first battleships built for the renewed Eight @-@ Eight Fleet Program were the two dreadnoughts of the <unk> class , ordered in 1907 and laid down in 1908 . In 1910 , the Navy put forward a request to the Diet ( parliament ) to secure funding for the entirety of the program at once . Because of economic constraints , only four battlecruisers and a single battleship of the <unk> class were ultimately approved by the Diet . Three more <unk> @-@ class ships ( <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) were approved and all three were ordered in April 1913 . While <unk> was laid down later that year , the <unk> lacked the funding to proceed with the construction of <unk> and <unk> until the Diet authorized additional funding for the ships in July 1914 . 
 
 = = Design and description = = 
 
 The progress of <unk> 's construction , while the <unk> waited for the funding to be released and foreign developments , caused the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> @-@ class design . The distribution of the <unk> gun turrets was the most obvious flaw as they complicated the protection of the <unk> magazine and exposed more of the ship to the blast effects of the guns when they fired . Another issue was that Japanese sailors had problems maintaining a high rate of fire with the 45 @.@ 36 @-@ kilogram ( 100 @.@ 0 lb ) shells used in the manually loaded 152 @-@ millimetre ( 6 in ) secondary guns used in the <unk> class and earlier designs . To resolve this issue , the <unk> designed a smaller 140 @-@ millimetre ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) gun that offset its lighter shell weight with a higher rate of fire . It also decided that the barbette armour of the earlier ships was too thin and wanted a modest increase in speed to partially counter the higher speeds of the latest foreign ships like the British Queen Elizabeth @-@ class battleships and Russian <unk> @-@ class battlecruisers . For financial reasons more powerful engines could not be ordered so the new design was lengthened slightly and the boiler rooms enlarged to increase speed by 0 @.@ 5 knots ( 0 @.@ 93 km / h ; 0 @.@ 58 mph ) to 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) . To save weight the forecastle deck was shortened so that the lower <unk> gun turret was lower than in the <unk> class . This reduced the crew 's accommodations despite a significant increase in the crew 's numbers and naval historian <unk> <unk> believed that these ships had the worst <unk> of any Japanese capital ship . The final design was designated A @-@ 92 by the <unk> and differed enough from the A @-@ 64 design of the <unk> class that it was considered a separate class . 
 The ships had a length of 208 @.@ 18 metres ( <unk> ft 0 in ) overall , a beam of 28 @.@ 65 metres ( 94 ft 0 in ) and a draught of 8 @.@ 93 metres ( 29 ft 4 in ) at deep load . They displaced 36 @,@ 500 long tons ( 37 @,@ 100 t ) at deep load , roughly 650 long tons ( 660 t ) more than the preceding class . Their crew consisted of 1 @,@ 360 officers and enlisted men . They had a <unk> height of 1 @.@ 737 metres ( 5 ft 8 @.@ 4 in ) at deep load . 
 During the ships ' modernization during the 1930s , their forward <unk> were enlarged with multiple platforms added to their tripod <unk> . Both ships were also given torpedo <unk> to improve their underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armour . In addition , their <unk> were lengthened by 7 @.@ 62 metres ( 25 @.@ 0 ft ) . These changes increased their overall length to 213 @.@ 8 metres ( 701 ft ) , their beam to 31 @.@ 75 metres ( 104 ft 2 in ) and their draft to 9 @.@ 45 metres ( 31 ft 0 in ) . Their displacement increased over 5 @,@ 000 long tons ( 5 @,@ 100 t ) to 42 @,@ 001 long tons ( 42 @,@ <unk> t ) at deep load . The crew now numbered 1 @,@ <unk> officers and enlisted men .

 The <unk> @-@ class ships had two sets of direct @-@ drive steam turbines , each of which drove two propeller shafts with 3 @.@ <unk> @-@ metre ( 11 ft 3 in ) propellers . The high @-@ pressure turbines drove the wing shafts while the low @-@ pressure turbines drove the inner shafts . The turbines were designed to produce a total of 40 @,@ 000 or 45 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 30 @,@ 000 or 34 @,@ 000 kW ) ( <unk> and <unk> respectively ) , using steam provided by 24 <unk> <unk> <unk> water @-@ tube boilers at working pressures of 13 – 16 @.@ 9 kg / <unk> ( 1 @,@ 275 – 1 @,@ <unk> <unk> ; 185 – 240 <unk> ) . Both ships comfortably exceeded their designed speed of 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) during their sea trials ; <unk> reached 23 @.@ 6 knots ( 43 @.@ 7 km / h ; 27 @.@ 2 mph ) from 56 @,@ <unk> shp ( 42 @,@ 131 kW ) and <unk> exceeded that with 24 knots ( 44 km / h ; 28 mph ) from 63 @,@ <unk> shp ( 47 @,@ 136 kW ) . Each of the boilers consumed a mixture of coal and oil and the ships had a stowage capacity of 4 @,@ <unk> long tons ( 4 @,@ <unk> t ) of coal and 1 @,@ <unk> long tons ( 1 @,@ <unk> t ) of fuel oil , which gave them a range of 9 @,@ 680 nautical miles ( 17 @,@ 930 km ; 11 @,@ 140 mi ) at a speed of 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) . <unk> and <unk> had three generators of 150 <unk> ( 200 hp ) capacity and two 250 @-@ <unk> ( 340 hp ) <unk> generators at 225 volts . 
 During their 1930s modernization , the boilers on each ship were replaced by eight new <unk> oil @-@ fired boilers , fitted into the former aft boiler room , and the forward funnel was removed . The turbines were replaced by four geared <unk> turbines with a designed output of 80 @,@ 000 shp ( 60 @,@ 000 kW ) intended to increase their speed to 24 @.@ 5 knots ( 45 @.@ 4 km / h ; 28 @.@ 2 mph ) . On her trials , <unk> reached a top speed of 25 @.@ 26 knots ( 46 @.@ 78 km / h ; 29 @.@ 07 mph ) from 81 @,@ 050 shp ( 60 @,@ 440 kW ) . The fuel storage of the ships was increased to a total of 5 @,@ 113 long tons ( 5 @,@ 195 t ) of fuel oil that gave them a range of 7 @,@ <unk> nautical miles ( 14 @,@ 580 km ; 9 @,@ 060 mi ) at a speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) .

 The twelve 45 @-@ calibre 35 @.@ 6 cm ( 14 @.@ 0 in ) Type 41 guns of the <unk> class were mounted in three pairs of twin @-@ gun , superfiring turrets . <unk> one through six from front to rear , each turret weighed <unk> long tons ( <unk> t ) . The <unk> powered turrets had an elevation capability of − 5 / + 20 degrees . The guns had a rate of fire of 1 @.@ 5 – 2 rounds per minute and could be loaded at any angle between <unk> and + 20 degrees . In 1921 the elevation was increased to + 30 degrees and then to + 43 degrees during their mid @-@ 1930s modernization , except for No. 6 turret as its supporting structure could not be lowered . The <unk> mechanism of the guns was also changed from a hydraulic to a <unk> system , which allowed for a faster firing cycle of the main guns . 
 By World War II , the guns used Type 91 armour @-@ piercing , capped shells . Each of these shells weighed <unk> @.@ 5 kilograms ( 1 @,@ <unk> lb ) and was fired at a muzzle velocity of 770 – 775 metres per second ( 2 @,@ <unk> – 2 @,@ 540 ft / s ) . They had a maximum range of 25 @,@ 000 metres ( 27 @,@ 000 yd ) at + 20 degrees of elevation and 35 @,@ 450 meters ( 38 @,@ 770 yd ) at + 43 degrees after modernization . Also available was a 625 @-@ kilogram ( 1 @,@ <unk> lb ) high @-@ explosive shell that had a muzzle velocity of 805 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 640 ft / s ) . A special Type 3 <unk> incendiary shrapnel shell was developed in the 1930s for anti @-@ aircraft use . 
 The ships ' secondary armament consisted of twenty 50 @-@ calibre 14 @-@ <unk> Type 3 . Eighteen of these were mounted in casemates in the forecastle and superstructure and the remaining pair were mounted on the deck above them and protected by gun shields . They had a maximum elevation of + 20 degrees which gave them ranges of 16 @,@ 300 metres ( 17 @,@ 800 yd ) . Each gun had a rate of fire of up to 10 rounds per minute . Anti @-@ aircraft defence was provided by four 40 @-@ calibre 3rd Year Type 8 @-@ <unk> AA guns in single mounts . The 7 @.@ 62 @-@ <unk> ( 3 in ) high @-@ angle guns had a maximum elevation of + 75 degrees , and had a rate of fire of 13 to 20 rounds per minute . They fired a 6 kg ( 13 lb ) <unk> with a muzzle velocity of 680 m / s ( 2 @,@ 200 ft / s ) to a maximum height of 7 @,@ 500 metres ( 24 @,@ 600 ft ) . The ships were also fitted with six submerged 53 @.@ 3 @-@ <unk> ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes , three on each broadside . They carried twelve to eighteen 6th Year Type torpedoes which had a 200 @-@ kilogram ( 440 lb ) warhead . They had three settings for range and speed : 15 @,@ 000 metres ( 16 @,@ 000 yd ) at 26 knots ( 48 km / h ; 30 mph ) , 10 @,@ 000 metres ( 11 @,@ 000 yd ) at 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) , or 7 @,@ 000 metres ( 7 @,@ 700 yd ) at 37 knots ( 69 km / h ; 43 mph ) . 
 In 1931 – 33 the AA guns were replaced with eight 40 @-@ caliber 12 @.@ 7 cm ( 5 @.@ 0 in ) Type 89 dual @-@ purpose guns , fitted on both sides of the forward <unk> in four twin @-@ gun mounts . When firing at surface targets , the guns had a range of 14 @,@ 700 metres ( 16 @,@ 100 yd ) ; they had a ceiling of 9 @,@ 440 metres ( 30 @,@ 970 ft ) at their maximum elevation of + 90 degrees . Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute , but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute . Two twin @-@ gun mounts for license @-@ built Vickers two @-@ pounder light AA guns were also added . These guns had a maximum elevation of + 80 degrees and a rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute . The pair of 14 cm guns on the upper deck were removed at this time . 
 During the mid @-@ 1930s reconstruction the torpedo tubes were removed and the Vickers two @-@ pounders were replaced by twenty license @-@ built <unk> 25 mm Type 96 light AA guns in 10 twin @-@ gun mounts . This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II , but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon . According to historian Mark <unk> , the twin and triple mounts " lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation ; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets ; the gun exhibited excessive vibration ; the magazine was too small , and , finally , the gun produced excessive muzzle blast " . These 25 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) guns had an effective range of 1 @,@ 500 – 3 @,@ 000 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 – 3 @,@ 300 yd ) , and an effective ceiling of 5 @,@ 500 metres ( 18 @,@ 000 ft ) at an elevation of 85 degrees . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen @-@ round magazines . In addition the forward pair of 14 cm guns in the forecastle were removed at this time and the maximum elevation of the remaining guns was increased to + 30 degrees .

 The <unk> @-@ class ships ' waterline protective belt had a maximum thickness of <unk> mm ( 11 @.@ 8 in ) of Vickers cemented armour amidships ; below it was a <unk> of 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) armour . The upper armoured deck consisted of two layers of high @-@ tensile steel 55 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) thick and the lower armoured deck also consisted of two layers of high @-@ tensile steel , but only 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick . The sides of this deck sloped downwards to meet the bottom of the lower <unk> of the belt armour . The ends of the belt armour were closed off by bulkheads that ranged in thickness from 203 to 102 mm ( 8 to 4 in ) . The turrets were protected with an armour thickness of 254 mm ( 10 in ) on the face and 76 mm on the roof . The casemate armour was 149 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick and that of the barbettes was <unk> mm thick rather than the originally planned 305 mm . The sides of the conning tower were 305 mm thick . 
 The <unk> class were the only Japanese battleships to place the powder magazine above the shell magazine as the <unk> wished to put as much space as possible between the highly flammable propellant and mine and torpedo <unk> . The danger from <unk> shells at long distances was not appreciated until the fatal magazine explosions of three British battlecruisers during the 1916 Battle of Jutland <unk> demonstrated the point . To further protect the magazines the depth of the double bottom was increased to a total of 3 @.@ 58 metres ( 11 ft 9 in ) underneath the barbettes and magazines . Additionally , the vessels contained 660 <unk> compartments to preserve <unk> in the event of battle damage . In addition to the torpedo <unk> added when the ships were modernized , the deck armour over the machinery and magazines was increased to a total thickness of 140 mm . Inside the original skin of the ships , two torpedo bulkheads were also added and the turret roofs were increased to a total of 152 millimetres ( 6 in ) of armour .

 While the details of the ship 's fire @-@ control instruments are not fully available , it is known that the ships were fitted with a fire @-@ control director after completion . No computer was fitted at that time and data from the rangefinders had to be processed manually . <unk> 2 , 3 , and 5 were built with imported 6 @-@ metre ( 19 ft 8 in ) <unk> & <unk> rangefinders . These were felt to be inferior to the British <unk> & Stroud instruments used on other ships and were removed in 1920 . They were replaced by either the British rangefinders or domestically built instruments of 6 or 8 metres ( 19 ft 8 in or 26 ft 3 in ) length . In the late 1920s the fire @-@ control systems were upgraded and additional platforms were added to the foremast to accommodate them . A pair of directors for the 12 @.@ 7 cm AA guns were added , one on each side of the forward superstructure , in the early 1930s . The fire @-@ control systems were again upgraded in the mid @-@ 1930s and directors were added for the 25 mm AA guns . Both ships had 10 @-@ metre ( 32 ft 10 in ) rangefinders installed at the top of the pagoda mast at that time . Type 21 air @-@ search <unk> were installed aboard the sisters in mid @-@ 1942 .

 <unk> was briefly fitted with an aircraft flying @-@ off platform for a <unk> <unk> fighter on <unk> No. 2 in 1927 .

A catapult and a <unk> 4 @-@ <unk> ( 3 @.@ 9 @-@ long @-@ ton ) crane were fitted on the stern during the mid @-@ 1930s modernization , and the ships were equipped to operate three <unk> , although no hangar was provided . The initial Nakajima <unk> <unk> were replaced by Nakajima <unk> <unk> in 1938 .

 The sinking of the British capital ships Prince of Wales and Repulse by Japanese land @-@ based aircraft on 10 December 1941 led the <unk> to realize that battleships could not operate in the face of enemy aircraft and required friendly air support to protect them . The loss of four Japanese aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in June 1942 severely limited the ability of the <unk> to provide any air cover and <unk> were sought . Earlier proposals to convert one or more battleships into carriers had been made and rejected at the beginning of the war , but they were revived after Midway . Plans for more elaborate <unk> were rejected on the grounds of expense and , most critically , time , and the <unk> settled on removing the rear pair of turrets and replacing them with a flight deck equipped with two <unk> to launch <unk> . The <unk> @-@ class ships were selected for the conversion because <unk> had suffered an explosion in <unk> No. 5 in early May that virtually destroyed the turret and their <unk> No. 6 could not elevate to the full + 43 degrees deemed necessary for the long @-@ range engagement anticipated by the <unk> . The <unk> were scheduled to follow once the first two were completed .

 The rear turrets , the barbettes and their supporting structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the openings in the middle deck were covered by 152 mm plates salvaged from the turret armour . All of the 14 cm guns were removed and the casemate openings sealed off . Four additional twin 12 @.@ 7 cm mounts were added , one pair abreast the funnel and the other abreast the conning tower . The original ten twin 25 mm gun mounts were replaced by triple mounts and nine new triple mounts were added , a total of 57 guns . Two each Type 94 and Type 95 AA directors were added to control the additional guns . The ammunition for these new guns was stored in the magazines originally used for the 14 cm guns and for <unk> No. 5 . During 1944 , the ships ' AA defences were reinforced with an additional dozen triple and eleven single 25 mm gun mounts , for a total of 104 barrels , and a pair of Type 13 early warning <unk> were added . In September six 30 @-@ round AA rocket launchers were added on the sides of the flight deck .

 A 70 @-@ metre @-@ long ( <unk> ft 8 in ) flight deck was built above the stern and stretched forward to the rebuilt aft superstructure . The flight deck was 29 metres ( 95 ft 2 in ) wide at its forward end and 13 metres ( 42 ft 8 in ) at the stern . It <unk> the stern and increased the overall length of the ships to 219 @.@ 62 metres ( 720 ft 6 in ) . A pair of rotating gunpowder @-@ propelled <unk> were fitted on the sides of the hull , forward of the aft superstructure where they partially restricted the arc of fire of the two amidships turrets . They could launch aircraft up to 4 @,@ 600 kilograms ( 10 @,@ 100 lb ) in weight and required 30 seconds to launch each aircraft . The flight deck had eight permanent storage positions connected by rails to the <unk> and the <unk> operated aircraft lift that brought the aircraft up from the hangar below on the trolleys used to move the <unk> about . Two aircraft were intended to be <unk> on the <unk> and three more in temporary positions on the flight deck for a total of thirteen . 
 The 40 @-@ metre @-@ long ( 131 ft 3 in ) hangar was 20 metres ( 65 ft 7 in ) wide forward and 11 metres ( 36 ft 1 in ) at the rear . It was 6 metres ( 19 ft 8 in ) high and designed to <unk> nine aircraft . It was fitted with fire fighting <unk> and carbon dioxide <unk> as a result of wartime experience . The ' T ' <unk> lift was 12 @.@ 1 metres ( 39 ft 8 in ) wide at its forward end and 6 @.@ 6 metres ( 21 ft 8 in ) wide at the its aft end . It was 12 @.@ 1 metres long and had a capacity of 6 tonnes ( 5 @.@ 9 long tons ) . <unk> storage tanks with a capacity of 76 tonnes ( 75 long tons ) were installed in the former magazine of <unk> No. 6 to provide each aircraft with enough fuel for three sorties . To recover the aircraft the <unk> crane formerly on the stern was moved up to the port side of the flight deck . Another crane was intended on the starboard side , but it was never fitted . 
 The ships had an air group of 11 each of <unk> <unk> dive bombers ( Allied reporting name " Judy " ) and <unk> <unk> reconnaissance aircraft ( Allied reporting name " Paul " ) Both aircraft had development problems and neither air group ever had all of its intended aircraft . Coupled with a shortage of trained pilots , neither ship ever used its aircraft during combat .

 After the loss of the fast battleship <unk> at the Naval Battle of <unk> in late 1942 to rudder damage , the <unk> decided to reinforce the protection of the steering compartment and to create an auxiliary steering compartment . The protection of the former was strengthened by the addition of a concrete wall at least 1 metre ( 3 ft 3 in ) in thickness and some of the armour removed from the turrets was used to protect the latter . The double bottom below the former positions of aft turrets was converted to hold fuel oil ; this increased the ships ' endurance to 9 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 17 @,@ 600 km ; 10 @,@ 900 mi ) at a speed of 16 knots . A pair of Type 22 surface @-@ search <unk> were also fitted during the conversion . 
 The removal of the secondary armament , the rear turrets and their supporting structures was generally compensated by the addition of the flight deck , hangar , AA guns and more fuel , and the <unk> height increased <unk> metres ( 9 @.@ 1 in ) to 2 @.@ 81 metres ( 9 ft 3 in ) at full load as a result of the reduction in the displacement by over 2 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 2 @,@ 000 long tons ) to 40 @,@ <unk> tonnes ( 39 @,@ 805 long tons ) . This also reduced the draught to 9 @.@ 03 metres ( 29 ft 8 in ) . The overhang of the flight deck at the stern increased the overall length to 219 @.@ 62 metres ( 720 ft 6 in ) and the beam was slightly reduced to 31 @.@ 71 metres ( 104 ft 0 in ) .

 Upon commissioning , the sister ships were assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet . <unk> had an explosion in one of her main gun turrets that killed 11 men and injured 25 in 1919 ; the following year she accidentally collided with and sank a schooner , losing two crewmen . Before the start of the Pacific War , both ships frequently exercised off the coasts of the Soviet Union , Korea and China in addition to training in Japanese waters . <unk> hosted Edward , Prince of Wales , and his aide @-@ de @-@ camp Lieutenant Louis <unk> in 1922 during the prince 's visit to Japan . In Korea Bay when the 1923 Great <unk> earthquake struck , they sailed to <unk> where they loaded supplies from for the victims on 4 September . Together with two other battleships and a pair of light cruisers , <unk> sank the destroyer <unk> in 1926 during gunnery practice . <unk> 's AA armament was upgraded in 1931 and <unk> 's two years later . The latter ship was modernized in 1934 – 36 and <unk> in 1935 – 37 , both at <unk> Naval Arsenal . During the Second <unk> @-@ Japanese War , the sisters frequently patrolled the Chinese coast in support of the blockade imposed by Japan . In August 1937 <unk> ferried two battalions of Special Naval Landing Forces to Port Arthur . Three years later , she served as the flagship for the Emperor of the puppet state of <unk> , Henry <unk> @-@ <unk> , during his state visit to Japan in June 1940 . On 15 November the ships were transferred to the 2nd Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet . The sisters were refitted in late 1940 in preparation for war , which included the fitting of external <unk> <unk> and additional AA directors .

 When Japan began the Pacific War on 8 December , the sisters sortied for the <unk> Islands with four other battleships and the light carrier <unk> as distant cover for the fleet attacking Pearl Harbor , and returned six days later . On 11 March 1942 <unk> and <unk> sortied from their anchorage at <unk> to join the unsuccessful search for the American carrier force that had attacked Marcus Island a week earlier . Similarly they pursued but did not catch the American carriers that had launched the <unk> Raid on 18 April . 
 During gunnery training on 5 May , there was a premature detonation in the left gun of <unk> 's <unk> No. 5 that disabled both guns and killed 51 crewmen . Both aft magazines were flooded to <unk> the resulting fire and save the ship . She received temporary repairs during which the turret was removed and replaced by a circular armour plate on which three triple 25 mm gun mounts were positioned . On 11 May a valve in <unk> 's No. 2 engine room stuck in the open position and flooded the engine room . While under repair at <unk> , both ships received prototype Type 21 <unk> . <unk> by Vice @-@ Admiral <unk> <unk> , the 2nd Battleship Division set sail with the <unk> Support Group on 28 May , at the same time that most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island ( Operation <unk> ) . 
 They returned home on 14 June and the <unk> began preliminary planning to replace the lost carriers with hybrid carriers converted from battleships . The sisters were selected for conversion and detached from the division on 14 July in preparation . They remained on " standby alert " until the actual <unk> began . <unk> was converted at <unk> Naval Arsenal from 23 February to 5 September 1943 and <unk> at <unk> Naval Arsenal from 2 May to 30 November . 
 After completing her sea trials , <unk> was attached to the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at <unk> and ferried troops and munitions to the naval base at <unk> in October . In November the ship began working up , joined by the newly completed <unk> the following month , and both rejoined the 2nd Battleship Division . On 1 May 1944 , the sisters were transferred to Rear Admiral <unk> <unk> 's reformed Fourth Carrier Division of the 3rd Fleet . The division 's <unk> Naval Air Group was formed that same day and conducted its first catapult launches in late June .

 <unk> of aircraft and <unk> problems greatly <unk> pilot training and the ships only had a total of 17 <unk> and 18 <unk> on hand on 1 October ; of these , only 6 and 16 were operational , respectively . The Japanese plan for the defence of the Philippines envisioned that the surviving carriers would be used to lure the American carrier forces away from the invasion area to a position where the carriers could be attacked by land @-@ based aircraft and the transports by the rest of the <unk> . The other carrier air groups were not in much better shape and the Japanese decided to retain the aircraft ashore for use against the American carriers . The Fourth Carrier Division was assigned to the Northern Force under the command of Vice Admiral <unk> Ozawa and the sisters sailed from <unk> on 20 October . On the morning of 24 October , the bulk of the few aircraft aboard were launched to attack the American carriers as a distraction . They inflicted no damage and caused the Americans to search in the direction from which they had attacked . The Americans finally spotted the Japanese carriers at 16 : 40 , some 200 miles ( 320 km ) east of Cape <unk> , the northeastern tip of Luzon . The American carriers were spread out and it was very late in the day to launch an <unk> , so Admiral William <unk> , commander of the Third Fleet decided to mass his carriers in a position to attack the following morning . Ozawa reversed course during the night , correctly believing that the Americans would follow him north . 
 Although they had lost contact during the night , the Americans did find the Japanese carriers at 07 : 35 . They had already launched an <unk> of 180 aircraft that was orbiting 50 miles ( 80 km ) ahead of the American carriers while waiting for the Japanese ships to be located . This was just the first of a total of five airstrikes that the Americans launched that day . The sisters were not heavily engaged by the early airstrikes which are focusing on the group 's aircraft carriers . <unk> claimed to have shot down five attacking dive bombers from the second wave and one small bomb detonated on <unk> No. 2 . <unk> was lightly damaged by near misses that rupture some hull plating in her <unk> and <unk> her superstructure with splinters . She took on a 5 @-@ degree list that was quickly corrected before she was ordered to tow the crippled carrier <unk> to safety . Her attempt was unsuccessful and <unk> had to be abandoned to her fate . 
 <unk> was attacked by 80 @-@ odd aircraft from the fourth wave , but they failed to inflict any serious damage . She <unk> 11 torpedoes and was only hit by a bomb once , on the <unk> <unk> of the port catapult . Some 34 other bombs near missed her , spraying her with splinters and <unk> some hull plates that contaminated some fuel oil and caused leaks in her port boiler rooms . While an exact total of her casualties is not available , it has been estimated that 5 men were killed and some 111 – 121 crewmen were wounded during this attack . <unk> was unsuccessfully attacked by an American submarine at 18 : 43 . Around 19 : 00 Ozawa learned about a force of destroyers and cruisers that drove off the Japanese destroyers rescuing survivors from some of the carriers lost earlier in the day and sank <unk> . He ordered the Fourth Carrier Division to reverse course and engage the Americans , but the battleships were unable to find them , and Ozawa ordered them to reverse course and head for <unk> <unk> . When they arrived on 27 October , Ozawa transferred to <unk> and <unk> his flag aboard her . While en route for <unk> , the division was unsuccessfully attacked by another submarine . 
 In early November the <unk> were removed from both ships , and they loaded troops and munitions later that month . While en route they were diverted to the <unk> Islands upon reports of heavy air raids at Manila . After off @-@ loading their cargo , they sailed for <unk> Island , near Singapore , on 20 November . They transferred to Cam <unk> Bay , French Indochina and <unk> became flagship of the 5th Fleet there on 14 December . The division sailed for Singapore on 30 December and Vice Admiral <unk> <unk> transferred his flag to the light cruiser <unk> on arrival there the following day . The division continued onwards to <unk> . Its planned return to Japan was delayed by attacks by the American Third Fleet on targets in Indochina and southern China that sank two oil tankers that were intended to refuel the division . 
 The <unk> then decided to use the sisters and their escorts to bring a load of petrol , rubber , tin and other strategic minerals back to Japan after the American carriers departed the South China Sea ( Operation <unk> ) . They loaded their cargoes beginning on 6 February at Singapore and departed four days later . Also carrying some 1 @,@ 150 <unk> workers , they were escorted by <unk> and three destroyers . <unk> Japanese radio signals revealed the Japanese plan to the Allies , and 15 submarines were positioned along their anticipated route in an attempt to intercept and sink the ships . An additional 11 were moved into position while the group was en route , but only three were ultimately able to attack . None of them were successful before the Japanese reached <unk> on 20 February . The Fourth Carrier Division was disbanded on 1 March and the sisters were reduced to 1st rank reserve ships . On 19 March <unk> was attacked by aircraft from Task Force 58 and <unk> was hit three times by bombs that killed 37 men and wounded 52 . Her gunners claimed to have shot down one American dive bomber during the attack . <unk> was hit twice during the attack , but her casualties , if any , are unknown . 
 The ships were turned into floating AA batteries over the next several months although it <unk> them little when they were attacked again by American carrier aircraft in July . On the 24th <unk> was struck by five bombs and near missed multiple times ; all told she lost 50 crewmen killed and many others wounded . The bombs started numerous leaks and <unk> began to settle by the bow , although she was returned to an even keel after three @-@ days pumping . <unk> was a primary focus of the attack and she received 10 direct hits and up to 30 near misses . She was badly damaged with some 200 @-@ odd crewmen killed and 600 wounded during the attack . She slowly <unk> over the next two days and was not attacked when the Americans returned four days later . This time it was <unk> 's turn and she was struck 11 or more times with many near misses that put her on the bottom in shallow water with a 15 degree list . The sisters were struck off the Navy List in November and their wrecks were scrapped after the war .

 Richard Gale " Dick " <unk> ( August 21 , 1926 – December 5 , 1994 ) was an American football player and a pioneering television broadcaster for the forerunner to <unk> @-@ TV in Buffalo . He played college football for the University of Michigan Wolverines in 1944 and from 1946 to 1948 . He was a consensus selection at end on the 1948 College Football All @-@ America Team . <unk> played professionally in the National Football League ( NFL ) with the Detroit Lions for one season in 1950 . After retiring from football he settled in Buffalo and became a sports broadcaster . He worked as a color commentator and as a play @-@ by @-@ play announcer for the Buffalo Bulls . He hosted various television and radio sports shows and was eventually inducted into the Buffalo <unk> Hall of Fame . 
 In college , he led the Big Ten Conference in single season receptions during his senior year and set Michigan Wolverines receptions records for both career touchdown and single @-@ season touchdowns . He had also been a Michigan High School Athletic Association ( <unk> ) state champion in both basketball and track and field . His college career was interrupted by World War II service , and his high school career was also affected by the war due to the <unk> 's cancellation of state championships in all sports in 1943 .

 <unk> was born in <unk> , Michigan , and raised in Kalamazoo , Michigan before his family moved to Saginaw , Michigan . <unk> was a star athlete at Saginaw 's Arthur Hill High School in football , basketball , and track and field . In 1943 , Michigan canceled boys high school tournaments in all sports due to World War II , and they did not return until the fall of 1944 . In 1944 , he led Arthur Hill High to the <unk> Class A high school basketball championship ( over Kalamazoo Central High School ) , scoring 24 points , including 17 in the second half , of the championship game . <unk> was also the state champion in 1944 in both the shot put 46 feet 11 inches ( 14 @.@ 30 m ) and high jump 5 feet 8 @.@ 5 inches ( 1 @.@ 74 m ) . He also led Arthur Hill in football , and his high school accomplishments are featured in Glory : The history of Saginaw County sports by Jack <unk> ( ASIN <unk> ) , which is a book on high school sports in Saginaw County , Michigan . <unk> was named All State in football , basketball and track . 
 It is ironic that <unk> was born in <unk> , Michigan in 1926 for several reasons . Ted <unk> preceded <unk> as an All @-@ American end on the University of Michigan football team . <unk> had excelled as a representative of Saginaw County in <unk> competition . <unk> posted significant football accomplishments in 1926 making 1926 a significant year for himself as well . <unk> All @-@ American status as an end at Michigan would be <unk> 's next step after <unk> in <unk> competition .

 In the fall of 1944 , <unk> enrolled at the University of Michigan . The United Press syndicate ran a feature article about <unk> in September 1944 that opened as follows : " Another great end has made his appearance on the Big Ten football horizon in the person of Dick <unk> , 18 @-@ year @-@ old Michigan freshman . Every so often a great offensive end comes along , a player who has to learn how to play defense , but who has the natural speed , smooth actions , height and big hands that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver . <unk> has laid claim to that rating . A loose @-@ <unk> 180 @-@ pound freshman from Saginaw , <unk> . , <unk> is being <unk> as the Big Ten 's next ' freshman sensation . ' " As a freshman , he caught two touchdown passes in his first college football game against Iowa . In an article titled " <unk> and <unk> , " Time reported on <unk> 's performance : " Of the few teams already in action , Michigan 's teens rang the freshman bell <unk> last week by winning their opener , 12 <unk> @-@ 7 , against the strong Iowa Seahawks ( Naval Pre @-@ Flight ) ; 6 @-@ ft . 4 Freshman End Dick <unk> caught passes and ran for both Michigan touchdowns . " 
 <unk> 's college career was interrupted by World War II service in the United States Navy , but after missing the 1945 season , he returned to play for the Wolverines from 1946 to 1948 . <unk> played for the Wolverines in consecutive undefeated National Championship seasons in 1947 and 1948 . He started nine games for the 1947 team . The 1947 team referred to as " Michigan 's Mad <unk> " is considered to be the greatest University of Michigan football team of all time . <unk> and teammate Len Ford had the reputation as the team practical <unk> . During the 1947 game against Wisconsin , <unk> started calling signals for the <unk> . Wisconsin 's offense protested to officials , who " <unk> the Wolverines secondary but never caught their man . " <unk> continued to scramble <unk> signals , as <unk> 's teammates laughed at his scheme . In the January 1 , 1948 Rose Bowl that season , Michigan rolled to a 49 – 0 victory over USC , and they <unk> the Trojans 491 yards to 133 . <unk> caught a 29 @-@ yard pass for the game 's final score . 
 In the 1948 championship season , <unk> scored eight touchdowns , caught 22 passes , and gained 610 yards ( 508 receiving and 102 rushing ) . <unk> was the second highest scoring end in the nation in 1948 , and he was a consensus All @-@ American as a senior , being selected as first team on nine of the 11 All @-@ American teams . <unk> led the Big Ten in receptions . 
 Although <unk> finished fourth among <unk> <unk> voters in 1948 , he did not finish among the top eight . By comparison , Notre Dame end Leon Hart won the <unk> Trophy in 1949 but made only eight of the 11 All @-@ American teams . It is not clear why <unk> did not finish higher . However , it is fairly clear that sportswriters of that era had a bias against Michigan . In the Associated Press poll at the end of the 1947 season , the Notre Dame Fighting Irish were ranked ahead of the University of Michigan , though both teams were undefeated . Some noted that every Southern AP <unk> had voted for Notre Dame , which had yet to integrate , whereas three of Michigan 's star players ( Bob Mann , Gene <unk> , and Len Ford ) were African @-@ American . The Southern schools refused even to schedule games against schools that played African @-@ American players . 
 <unk> was considered one of the greatest <unk> 's of the 1940s . In four seasons with the Michigan Wolverines , <unk> played in 32 games and had over 1 @,@ 000 yards of total offense . <unk> held the University of Michigan 's single season and career record for touchdown receptions ( eight in a season ; sixteen career ) until his records were broken by Anthony Carter in 1980 .

 In 1948 , <unk> was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 15th round of the NFL draft , and he was also drafted by the New York Yankees of the All @-@ America Football Conference . He had intended to play in 1949 with the Yankees , but suffered a knee injury in a practice session for the August 1949 Chicago College All @-@ Star Game . Press accounts at the time noted that the injury " will probably keep him out of pro football all season , if not forever . " The incident led to a debate as to whether NFL owners should " bar their men from playing with the college all @-@ stars . " 
 <unk> landed a job at <unk> radio in Detroit , but he left his <unk> 's job to join the Detroit Lions . In the 1950 NFL season , <unk> came back from his injury to play for the Detroit Lions . He played in 12 games and had ten receptions for 96 yards and one touchdown for the 1950 Lions . <unk> recalled that his playing time with the Lions was limited because the Lions also signed 1949 <unk> Trophy winner Leon Hart , who played the same position . 
 In May 1951 , he announced he was retiring from professional football to become sports director at a radio station in Buffalo . He was hired as a <unk> by <unk> ( now known as <unk> ) , which had just started the first television station in Buffalo and the only one serving Southern Ontario . This was an early foray into television by the Buffalo Evening News . In the 1950s , <unk> hosted a popular panel show called " Let 's Talk Sports " in Buffalo and also pioneered an early morning exercise program . He also worked for <unk> ( AM ) and <unk> ( FM ) and as the <unk> announcer for Buffalo Bills games along with Van Miller , the long time Bills play @-@ by @-@ play announcer . In addition , he served as the play @-@ by @-@ play announcer for the University of Buffalo Bulls football team .

 After 30 years with <unk> and a change in ownership for the station , his show was replaced with the <unk> Network 's The Larry King Show .

He also sold <unk> for Buffalo Evening News competitor , Buffalo Courier @-@ Express . <unk> 's final employer was Erie County , who hired him as an inmate training supervisor at the Erie County <unk> <unk> . 
 <unk> was posthumously inducted into the Buffalo <unk> Hall of Fame in September 2007 . He was given the Golden Age Award which is reserved for " those who did it first , the people who had no pattern to follow . " The Hall of Fame award was presented to <unk> 's wife , Jane .

 = 1933 Treasure Coast hurricane = 
 
 The 1933 Treasure Coast hurricane was the second @-@ most intense tropical cyclone to strike the United States during the active 1933 Atlantic hurricane season . The eleventh tropical storm , fifth hurricane , and the third major hurricane of the season , it formed east @-@ northeast of the Leeward Islands on August 31 . The tropical storm moved rapidly west @-@ northwestward , steadily intensifying to a hurricane . It acquired peak winds of 140 miles per hour ( 225 km / h ) and passed over portions of the Bahamas on September 3 , including <unk> and Harbour Island , causing severe damage to crops , buildings , and infrastructure . Winds over 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) affected many islands in its path , especially those that encountered its center , and many wharves were ruined . 
 Subsequently , it weakened and made landfall at Jupiter , Florida , early on September 4 with winds of 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) . The hurricane moved across the state , passing near Tampa before moving into Georgia and dissipating . In Florida , the strong winds of the cyclone blew buildings off their foundations , and numerous trees were <unk> in citrus groves . The Treasure Coast region received the most extensive destruction , and Stuart , Jupiter , and Fort Pierce were heavily damaged . Inland , the cyclone weakened rapidly but produced prodigious amounts of rain , causing a dam to collapse near Tampa . The storm caused $ 3 million in damage ( 1933 USD ) after damaging or destroying 6 @,@ <unk> homes . 
 Unusually , the storm hit Florida less than 24 hours before another major hurricane bearing 125 @-@ mile @-@ per @-@ hour ( 201 km / h ) winds struck South Texas ; never have two major cyclones hit the United States in such close succession . 
 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 
 The origins of the hurricane were from a tropical wave that possibly spawned a tropical depression on August 27 , although there was minimal data over the next few days as it tracked to the west @-@ northwest . On August 31 , a nearby ship reported gale force winds , which indicated that a tropical storm had developed to the east @-@ northeast of the Lesser Antilles . Based on continuity , it is estimated the storm attained hurricane status later that day . Moving quickly to the west @-@ northwest , the storm passed north of the Lesser Antilles and Puerto Rico . Early on September 2 , a ship called the <unk> reported a barometric pressure of 978 mbar ( 28 @.@ 88 inHg ) , which confirmed that the storm attained hurricane status . After passing north of the Turks and <unk> islands , the hurricane struck <unk> and Harbour Island in the Bahamas on September 3 , the latter at 1100 UTC . A station on the latter island reported a pressure of 27 @.@ 90 inHg ( <unk> mb ) during the 30 minute passage of the eye . Based on the pressure and the small size of the storm , it is estimated the hurricane struck Harbour Island with peak winds of 140 mph ( 225 km / h ) , making it the equivalent of a modern Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale . <unk> suggested that the storm reached major hurricane status , or Category 3 status , on September 2 . 
 The hurricane initially followed the course of another hurricane that passed through the area in late August , which ultimately struck Cuba and Texas . This hurricane instead maintained a general west @-@ northwest track . After moving through the northern Bahamas , the hurricane weakened slightly before making landfall at Jupiter , Florida , at <unk> UTC on September 4 . A station there reported a pressure of 27 @.@ 98 inHg ( <unk> mb ) during a 40 minute period of the eye 's passage ; this suggested a landfall strength of 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) . At the time , the radius of maximum winds was 15 mi ( 24 km ) , which was smaller than average . After landfall , the hurricane weakened rapidly while crossing the state . It briefly emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm early on September 5 . A few hours later while continuing to the northwest , it made another landfall near <unk> — a ghost town in Levy County , east of Cedar Key — with winds of about 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) . Turning to the north , the storm slowly weakened as it crossed into Georgia , dissipating on September 7 near Augusta .

 On September 2 , a fleet of eight aircraft evacuated all white residents from West End , Grand <unk> , to <unk> Beach , Florida . While the storm was near peak intensity on September 3 , the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings from Miami to Melbourne , Florida , with storm warnings extending northward to Jacksonville . Later that day , storm warnings , were issued from Key West to Cedar Key . About 2 @,@ 500 people evacuated by train from areas around Lake Okeechobee . By evening on September 3 , high tides sent sea <unk> over coastal <unk> in Palm Beach County as residents boarded up buildings ; structures on <unk> Street in West Palm Beach were said to be a " solid front " of <unk> . Along the coast , observers reported very rough seas as the eye neared land . 
 The powerful hurricane moved over or near several islands in the Bahamas . Winds on Spanish Wells and Harbour Island were both estimated at around 140 mph ( 225 km / h ) . Winds reached 110 mph ( 177 km / h ) at Governor 's Harbour , 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) on <unk> , and 120 mph ( 193 km / h ) on the <unk> Islands . The storm was farther away from Nassau , where winds reached 61 mph ( 98 km / h ) . The hurricane damaged a lumber mill on <unk> , <unk> away a dock . Heavy damage occurred on Harbour Island , including to several roofs , the walls of government buildings , and the water system . The hurricane destroyed four churches and 37 houses , leaving 100 people homeless . A 1 @.@ 5 mi ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) road on <unk> was destroyed . Several islands sustained damage to farms , including the total loss of various fruit trees on Russell Island . Despite Category 4 winds on Spanish Wells , only five houses were destroyed , although most of the remaining dwellings lost their roofs . <unk> between North Point , James <unk> , and Gregory Town on <unk> , the storm destroyed 55 houses and damaged many others . On Grand <unk> , where a 9 to 12 ft ( 2 @.@ 7 to 3 @.@ 7 m ) storm surge was reported , half of the houses were destroyed , as were 13 boats and two planes , and most docks were wrecked . 
 When the storm moved ashore in Florida , winds reached an estimated 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) in Jupiter ; these occurred after the eye passed . In West Palm Beach , <unk> measured at least 80 @-@ mile @-@ per @-@ hour ( 129 km / h ) winds with gusts to 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) ; <unk> ranged from 28 @.@ 64 to 28 @.@ 78 inHg ( 970 to <unk> mb ) . The storm produced the strongest winds in the city since the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane . Winds were not as strong farther from the center ; 40 to 45 mph ( 64 to 72 km / h ) winds were observed in Miami to the south , <unk> to the north , and Tampa on the west coast . Fort Pierce estimated peak winds of 80 to 90 mph ( 129 to 145 km / h ) , and pressures dipped to 29 @.@ 14 inHg ( <unk> mb ) . Inland , winds near Lake Okeechobee peaked at only 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) . The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall along its path , peaking at 17 @.@ 8 in ( 450 mm ) in <unk> . 
 At West Palm Beach , the majority of the damage was confined to vegetation . Several <unk> and royal <unk> that withstood the 1928 hurricane snapped , <unk> streets with broken trunks . Winds downed road signs on many streets , and <unk> covered the <unk> on a local golf course . Some <unk> and isolated structures , mostly lightweight , were partly or totally destroyed , along with a lumber warehouse . Some homes that lost roofing shingles had water damage to their interiors as well . Nearby Lake Worth sustained extensive breakage of windows , including plate glass , and loss of tile and <unk> roofing , but preparations reduced losses to just several thousand dollars , and no post @-@ storm accidents took place . Strong winds snapped many light poles in the city , and trees and shrubs were broken or uprooted . As in Lake Worth , officials in West Palm Beach credited preparations and stringent building codes with reducing overall damage . The city had learned from previous experience with severe storms in 1926 , 1928 , and 1929 . High tides eroded Ocean Boulevard at several spots and disrupted access to several bridges on the Lake Worth <unk> . Winter estates and hotels on Palm Beach generally sustained little material damage , except to vegetation , and county properties went largely unscathed . 
 In Martin and St. Lucie counties , the storm was considered among the worst on record . The storm leveled some homes and swept many others off their foundations . At Stuart , winds removed or badly damaged 75 % of the roofs in town . The storm destroyed the third floor of the building that housed a bowling <unk> and the Stuart News , a local newspaper . At <unk> , an abandoned settlement also known as <unk> Beach , strong winds leveled the old <unk> Inn , a gas station , and the second floor of a <unk> building . Winds also tore the roof off an ice plant . A bridge leading to the barrier island from <unk> was partly wrecked ; the bridge tender survived by gripping the <unk> during the storm . Winds leveled his nearby home . According to the Monthly Weather Review , some of the most severe damage from the storm in Florida was at <unk> . The storm left many homes in <unk> Sound <unk> , forcing crews to tear them down . Winter estates on the island , however , were better built and little damaged . While Stuart and <unk> Sound sustained significant damage , Port <unk> suffered <unk> . In Stuart , the storm left 400 to 500 people homeless , up to nearly 10 % of the population , which was 5 @,@ 100 at the time . Between Jupiter and Fort Pierce , the storm knocked down power and telegraph lines . In the latter city , high waves washed out a portion of the causeway . In the 1980s , an elderly resident recalled that the storm was the most severe on record in Fort Pierce . 
 <unk> damage was worst along the Indian River <unk> ; several farms in Stuart experienced total losses , and <unk> , 16 % of the citrus crop , or 4 million boxes , were destroyed . Many chicken <unk> in Stuart were destroyed , and the local chicken population was scattered and dispersed as far as <unk> . Across southeastern Florida , the hurricane damaged 6 @,@ <unk> houses and destroyed another <unk> , causing over $ 3 million in damage . One person , an African American farm worker , was killed when his <unk> blew down in Gomez , a <unk> died after seven <unk> <unk> , and a child was killed by airborne debris . 
 High rainfall caused flooding across Florida , notably near Tampa where waters reached 9 ft ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) deep . High rainfall of over 7 in ( 180 mm ) caused a dam operated by Tampa Electric Co. to break 3 mi ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) northeast of Tampa along the <unk> River . The break resulted in severe local damage , flooding portions of <unk> Springs . Workers attempted to save the dam with <unk> , and after the break , most residents in the area were warned of the approaching flood . Over 50 homes were flooded , forcing about 150 people to evacuate . Outside Florida , the storm produced winds of 48 and 51 mph ( 78 and 81 km / h ) in Savannah , Georgia and Charleston , South Carolina , respectively . In the latter city , the storm spawned a tornado , which caused about $ 10 @,@ 000 in property damage . Heavy rainfall occurred along the Georgia and South Carolina coasts , reaching over 12 in ( 300 mm ) . Light rainfall also extended into North Carolina .

 In the Bahamas after the storm , a boat sailed from Nassau to deliver food and building materials to <unk> . 
 After the storm , the National Guard offered shelters for at least 400 homeless residents in Stuart . Of the 7 @,@ 900 families adversely affected by the hurricane , 4 @,@ 325 required assistance from the American Red Cross . <unk> in Texas , also affected by a major hurricane , requested <unk> in Florida wait 15 days so they could sell their citrus crop that fell . The damaged dam near Tampa initially resulted in waters from the <unk> River being pumped into the city 's water treatment plant , and a new dam was eventually built in 1944 . 
 
 
 = Second Battle of <unk> <unk> = 
 
 The Second Battle of <unk> <unk> was an engagement between United Nations ( UN ) and North Korean ( <unk> ) forces early in the Korean War from September 1 to September 15 , 1950 , along the <unk> River in South Korea . It was a part of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter , and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously . The battle ended in a victory for the United Nations after large numbers of United States ( US ) and Republic of Korea ( ROK ) troops repelled a strong North Korean attack . 
 After the First Battle of <unk> <unk> , the US Army 's 2nd Infantry Division was moved to defend the <unk> River line . The division , which was <unk> in combat , was struck with a strong attack by several divisions of the Korean People 's Army which crossed the river and struck all along the division 's line . The force of the attack split the US 2nd Infantry Division in half , and the North Koreans were able to penetrate to <unk> , promoting a fight there . 
 The urgency of the threat to Pusan Perimeter prompted the US Marine Corps 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to be brought in to reinforce the US Army troops . In two weeks of heavy fighting , the US forces were able to force the North Koreans out of the <unk> <unk> region . The North Koreans were further repulsed after the UN counterattack at <unk> , which culminated in the virtual destruction of the North Korean army .

 From the outbreak of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea by the North , the North Korean People 's Army had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the Republic of Korea Army and the United Nations forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing . The North Korean strategy was to aggressively pursue UN and ROK forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively , attacking from the front and initiating a double <unk> of both flanks of the unit , which allowed the North Koreans to surround and cut off the opposing force , which would then be forced to retreat in <unk> , often leaving behind much of its equipment . From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August , the North Koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south . However , when the UN forces , under the Eighth United States Army , established the Pusan Perimeter in August , the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which North Korean troops could not flank , and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN army . 
 When the North Koreans approached the Pusan Perimeter on August 5 , they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter . Throughout August , the <unk> 6th Division , and later the <unk> 7th Division engaged the US 25th Infantry Division at the Battle of <unk> , initially <unk> a UN counteroffensive before <unk> with battles at <unk> @-@ <unk> and Battle Mountain . These attacks stalled as UN forces , well equipped and with plenty of reserves , repeatedly repelled North Korean attacks . North of <unk> , the <unk> 4th Division and the US 24th Infantry Division <unk> in the <unk> <unk> area . In the First Battle of <unk> <unk> , the North Korean division was unable to hold its bridgehead across the river as large numbers of US reserve forces were brought in to repel it , and on August 19 , the <unk> 4th Division was forced back across the river with 50 percent casualties . In the <unk> region , five North Korean divisions were repulsed by three UN divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the Battle of <unk> . Particularly heavy fighting took place at the Battle of the <unk> <unk> where the <unk> 13th Division was almost completely destroyed in the attack . On the east coast , three more North Korean divisions were repulsed by the South Koreans at P 'ohang @-@ dong during the Battle of P 'ohang @-@ dong . All along the front , the North Korean troops were <unk> from these defeats , the first time in the war their strategies were not working . 
 
 = = = September push = = = 
 
 In planning its new offensive , the North Korean command decided any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN navy . Instead , they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope of achieving success in the battle . <unk> by intelligence from the Soviet Union the North Koreans were aware the UN forces were building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that it must conduct an offensive soon or it could not win the battle . A secondary objective was to surround <unk> and destroy the UN and ROK units in that city . As part of this mission , the North Korean units would first cut the supply lines to <unk> . 
 On August 20 , the North Korean commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units . The North Koreans called for a simultaneous five @-@ <unk> attack against the UN lines . These attacks would overwhelm the UN defenders and allow the North Koreans to break through the lines in at least one place to force the UN forces back . Five battle groupings were ordered . The center attack called for the <unk> 9th Division , <unk> 4th Division , <unk> 2nd Division , and <unk> 10th Division break through the US 2nd Infantry Division at the <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> .

 During the North Koreans ' September 1 offensive , the US 25th Infantry Division 's US 35th Infantry Regiment was heavily engaged in the Battle of <unk> River north of <unk> . On the 35th Regiment 's right flank , just north of the confluence of the <unk> River and the <unk> River , was the US 9th Infantry Regiment , US 2nd Infantry Division . There , in the southernmost part of the 2nd Infantry Division zone , the 9th Infantry Regiment held a sector more than 20 @,@ 000 yards ( 18 @,@ 000 m ) long , including the <unk> area of the <unk> where the First Battle of <unk> <unk> had taken place earlier in August . Each US infantry company on the river line here had a front of 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 m ) to 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) and they held only key hills and observation points , as the units were extremely spread out along the wide front . 
 During the last week of August , US troops on these hills could see minor North Korean activity across the river , which they thought was North Koreans organizing the high ground on the west side of the <unk> against a possible American attack . There were occasional attacks on the 9th Infantry 's forward positions , but to the men in the front lines this appeared to be only a standard patrol action . On August 31 , the UN forces were alerted to a pending attack when much of the Korean civilian labor force fled the front lines . Intelligence officers reported an attack was coming . 
 On the west side of the <unk> , North Korean Major General <unk> <unk> Sam , commanding the <unk> 9th Division , issued his operations order to the division on August 28 . Its mission in the forthcoming attack was to outflank and destroy the US troops at <unk> <unk> by capturing the <unk> and <unk> areas to cut off the US 2nd Division 's route of supply and withdrawal between <unk> and Pusan . However , the North Koreans weren 't aware that the US 2nd Infantry Division had recently replaced the US 24th Infantry Division in positions along the <unk> River . Consequently , they expected lighter resistance ; the 24th troops were exhausted from months of fighting but the 2nd Division men were fresh and newly arrived in Korea . They had only recently been moved into the line . The North Koreans began crossing the <unk> River under cover of darkness at certain points .

 On the southern @-@ most flank of the 9th Infantry river line , just above the junction of the <unk> River with the <unk> , A Company of the 1st Battalion was dug in on a long finger ridge <unk> the <unk> that terminates in Hill 94 at the <unk> ferry site . The river road from <unk> @-@ ri running west along the <unk> passes the southern tip of this ridge and crosses to the west side of the river at the ferry . A small village called <unk> lay at the base of Hill 94 and 300 yards ( 270 m ) from the river . A patrol of tanks and armored vehicles , together with two infantry squads of A Company , 9th Infantry , held a roadblock near the ferry and close to <unk> . On the evening of August 31 , A Company moved from its ridge positions overlooking <unk> and the river to new positions along the river below the ridge line . 
 That evening Sergeant Ernest R. <unk> led the patrol of two <unk> <unk> tanks and two <unk> Gun Motor <unk> in <unk> . <unk> placed his patrol on the west side of <unk> near the <unk> ferry . At 20 : 00 a heavy fog covered the river , and at 22 : 00 mortar shells began falling on the American @-@ held side of the river . By 22 : 15 this strike intensified and North Korean mortar preparation struck A Company 's positions . American mortars and artillery began firing <unk> . Some of the A Company men reported they heard noises on the opposite side of the river and splashes in the water . 
 At 22 : 30 the fog lifted and <unk> saw that a North Korean <unk> bridge was being laid across the river directly in front of his position . <unk> 's four vehicles attacked this structure , and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed , and the <unk> boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk . At 23 : 00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks . This gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise . 
 <unk> 's patrol was then ambushed by a group of North Koreans dressed in US military uniforms . <unk> was wounded and the other three vehicles had to withdraw , but he held the <unk> site until 07 : 30 the next morning with his single tank . In the attack against A Company , the North Koreans hit the 1st Platoon , which was near <unk> , but they did not find the 2nd Platoon northward . 
 The <unk> 9th Division 's infantry crossing of the <unk> and attack on its east side near midnight quickly overran the positions of C Company , north of A Company . There the North Koreans assaulted in force , signaled by green flares and blowing of whistles . The company held its positions only a short time and then attempted to escape . Many of the men moved south , a few of them coming into A Company 's ridge line positions near <unk> during the night . Most of C Company moved all the way to the 25th Division positions south of the <unk> . On September 1 that division reported that 110 men of C Company had come into its lines .

 Meanwhile , 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) north of <unk> and A Company 's position , B Company , 9th Infantry , held a similar position on Hill <unk> overlooking the <unk> ferry crossing of the river . This ferry was located at the middle of the <unk> <unk> where the <unk> road came down to the <unk> and crossed it . The US 2nd Infantry Division had planned a reconnaissance mission to start from there the night of August 31 , the same night that the <unk> I Corps offensive rolled across the river . 
 Near the end of the month two reconnaissance patrols from the 9th Infantry had crossed to the west side of the <unk> and observed North Korean tank and troop activity 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of the river . Information obtained later indicated it was in fact the command post of the <unk> 9th Division . On August 25 , 9th Infantry commander Colonel John G. Hill outlined projected " Operation <unk> , " which was to be a company @-@ sized combat patrol to cross the river , advance to the suspected North Korean command post and communications center , destroy it , capture prisoners , and collect intelligence . 
 The 9th Infantry Regiment had planned Task Force <unk> on orders from the 2nd Division commander Major General Laurence B. <unk> , which in turn had received instructions from Eighth United States Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker for aggressive patrolling . <unk> decided the patrol should cross the river at the <unk> ferry . The 9th Infantry reserve , E Company , reinforced with one section of light machine guns from H Company , was to be the attack force . The 1st Platoon , 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , was to transport it across the river in assault boats the night of August 31 . Two heavy weapons companies , D and H , were each to <unk> one section of heavy machine guns , one section of 81 @-@ <unk> mortars , and one section of 75 @-@ <unk> recoilless rifles for supporting fires . A platoon of 4 @.@ 2 @-@ inch mortars was also to give support . 
 After dark on August 31 , First Lieutenant Charles I. Caldwell of D Company and First Lieutenant Edward <unk> of H Company , 9th Infantry , moved their men and weapons to the base of Hill <unk> , which was within B Company 's defense sector and overlooked the <unk> ferry crossing of the <unk> River . The raiding force , E Company , was still in its regimental reserve position about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of <unk> , getting ready with the engineer platoon to move to the crossing site . Colonel Hill went forward in the evening with the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ inch mortar platoon to its position at the base of Hill <unk> where the <unk> prepared to set up their weapons . 
 By 21 : 00 , the closest front line unit was B Company on top of Hill <unk> , 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north of the river road which curved around the hill 's southern base . The regimental <unk> , Captain Lewis B. Sheen , had gone forward in the afternoon to B Company to hold services . On top of Hill <unk> , <unk> Sheen and men in B Company after dark heard <unk> in the water below them . They soon discovered a long line of North Korean soldiers wading the river . 
 The first North Korean crossing at the <unk> ferry caught the Heavy <unk> Platoon unprepared in the act of setting up its weapons . It also caught most of the D and H Company men at the base of Hill <unk> , <unk> miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) from the crossing site . The North Koreans killed or captured many of the troops there . Hill was there , but escaped to the rear just before midnight , together with several others , when the division canceled Operation <unk> because of the attacks . The first heavy weapons carrying party was on its way up the hill when the North Korean attack <unk> the men below . It <unk> on to the top where the advance group waited and there all hastily dug in on a small perimeter . This group was not attacked during the night . 
 From 21 : 30 until shortly after midnight the <unk> 9th Division crossed the <unk> at a number of places and climbed the hills quietly toward the 9th Infantry river line positions . Then , when the artillery barrage preparation lifted , the North Korean infantry were in position to launch their assaults . These began in the northern part of the regimental sector and quickly spread southward . At each crossing site the North Koreans would overwhelm local UN defenders before building <unk> bridges for their vehicles and armor . 
 At 02 : 00 , B Company was attacked . A truck stopped at the bottom of the hill , a whistle sounded , then came a shouted order , and North Korean soldiers started climbing the slope . The hills on both sides of B Company were already under attack as was also Hill 311 , a rugged terrain feature a 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) from the river and the North Koreans ' principal immediate objective . The North Koreans apparently were not aware of the Task Force <unk> group lower down on the hill and it was not attacked during the night . But higher up on Hill <unk> the North Koreans drove B Company from its position , inflicting very heavy casualties on it . Sheen led one group of soldiers back to friendly lines on 4 September . 
 At 03 : 00 , 1 September , the 9th Infantry Regiment ordered its only reserve , E Company to move west along the <unk> @-@ <unk> River road and take a blocking position at the pass between <unk> Hill and <unk> @-@ <unk> Ridge , 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) from the river and 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) from <unk> . This was the critical terrain where so much heavy fighting had taken place in the first battle of the <unk> <unk> . Fighting began at the pass at 02 : 30 when an American medium tank of A Company , 72nd Tank Battalion , knocked out a T @-@ 34 at <unk> , also called <unk> . E Company never reached its blocking position . A strong North Korean force surprised and delivered heavy automatic fire on it at 03 : 30 from positions <unk> the road east of the pass . The company suffered heavy casualties , including the company commander and <unk> 's aide who had accompanied the force . With the critical parts of <unk> Hill and <unk> @-@ <unk> Ridge , the best defensive terrain between <unk> and the river , the North Koreans controlled the high ground . The US 2nd Infantry Division now had to base its defense of <unk> on relatively poor defensive terrain , the low hills at the western edge of the town .

 North of the 9th Infantry sector of the 2nd Infantry Division front along the <unk> , the US 23rd Infantry Regiment on August 29 had just relieved the 3rd Battalion of the US 38th Infantry Regiment , which in turn had only a few days before relieved the US 21st Infantry Regiment of the US 24th Infantry Division . On August 1 , the 23rd Regiment was in a new sector of which it had only a limited knowledge . It took over a 16 @,@ 000 yards ( 15 @,@ 000 m ) <unk> River front without its 3rd Battalion which had been attached to the US 1st Cavalry Division to the north . Colonel Paul L. Freeman , the regimental commander , deployed the 1st Battalion on the high ground along the river with the three companies abreast . The 1st Battalion , under US Lieutenant Colonel Claire E. <unk> , Jr . , <unk> the hills with platoons and squads . He placed the 2nd Battalion in a reserve position 8 miles ( 13 km ) behind the 1st Battalion and in a position where it commanded the road net in the regimental sector . On August <unk> the 2nd Division moved E Company south to a reserve position in the 9th Infantry sector . 
 Two roads ran through the regimental sector from the <unk> River to <unk> . The main road bent south along the east bank of the river to <unk> @-@ <unk> and then turned northeast to <unk> . A northern secondary road curved around <unk> and lakes , the largest of which was Lake U @-@ p <unk> , to <unk> . In effect , the 1st Battalion of the 23rd Regiment guarded these two approach routes to <unk> . 
 The 42 men of the 2nd Platoon , B Company , 23rd Infantry held outpost positions on seven hills covering a 2 @,@ 600 yards ( 2 @,@ 400 m ) front along the east bank of the <unk> north of <unk> @-@ <unk> . Across the river in the rice <unk> they could see , in the afternoon of August 31 , two large groups of North Korean soldiers . Occasionally artillery fire dispersed them . Just before dark , the platoon saw a column of North Koreans come out of the hills and proceed toward the river . They immediately reported to the battalion command post . The artillery forward observer , who estimated the column at 2 @,@ 000 people , thought they were refugees . Freeman immediately ordered the artillery to fire on the column , reducing its number . However the North Koreans continued their advance . 
 At 21 : 00 the first shells of what proved to be a two @-@ hour North Korean artillery and mortar preparation against the American river positions of 2nd Platoon . As the barrage rolled on , North Korean infantry crossed the river and climbed the hills in the darkness under cover of its fire . At 23 : 00 the barrage lifted and the North Koreans attacked 2nd Platoon , forcing it from the hill after a short fight . Similar assaults took place elsewhere along the battalion outpost line . 
 On the regimental left along the main <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> road North Korean soldiers completely overran C Company by 0300 September 1 . Only seven men of C Company could be accounted for , and three days later , after all the stragglers and those cut off behind North Korean lines had come in , there were only 20 men in the company . As the North Korean attack developed during the night , 1st Battalion succeeded in withdrawing a large part of its force , less C Company , just north of Lake U @-@ p <unk> and the hills there covering the northern road into <unk> , 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) east of the river and 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) west of the town . B Company lost heavily in this action . 
 When word of the disaster that had <unk> 1st Battalion reached regimental headquarters , Freeman obtained the release of G and F Companies from 2nd Division reserve and sent the former to help 1st Battalion and the latter on the southern road toward <unk> @-@ <unk> and C Company . Major Lloyd K. Jenson , executive officer of the 2nd Battalion , accompanied F Company down the <unk> @-@ <unk> road . This force was unable to reach C Company , but Jenson collected stragglers from it and seized high ground <unk> this main approach to <unk> near <unk> <unk> @-@ ri above Lake <unk> , and went into a defensive position there . The US 2nd Division released E Company to the regiment and the next day it joined F Company to build up what became the main defensive position of the <unk> Regiment in front of <unk> . North Korean troops during the night passed around the right flank of 1st Battalion 's northern blocking position and reached the road three miles behind him near the division artillery positions . The 23rd Infantry Headquarters and Service Companies and other <unk> regimental units finally stopped this penetration near the regimental command post 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) northwest of <unk> .

 Before the morning of 1 September had passed , reports coming in to US 2nd Division headquarters made it clear that North Koreans had penetrated to the north @-@ south <unk> @-@ <unk> road and cut the division in two ; the 38th and <unk> Infantry Regiments with the bulk of the division artillery in the north were separated from the division headquarters and the 9th Infantry Regiment in the south . <unk> decided that this situation made it <unk> to control and direct the divided division as two special forces . Accordingly , he placed the division artillery commander , Brigadier General Loyal M. Haynes , in command of the northern group . Haynes ' command post was 7 miles ( 11 km ) north of <unk> . Task Force Haynes became operational at 10 : 20 , September 1 . <unk> , in the <unk> area , <unk> placed Brigadier General Joseph S. Bradley , Assistant Division Commander , in charge of the 9th Infantry Regiment , the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , most of the 72nd Tank Battalion , and other <unk> units of the division . This southern grouping was known as Task Force Bradley . 
 All three regiments of the <unk> 2nd Division @-@ the 4th , 17th , and 6th , in line from north to south @-@ crossed during the night to the east side of the <unk> River into the 23rd Regiment sector . The <unk> 2nd Division , concentrated in the <unk> @-@ <unk> area west of the river , had , in effect , attacked straight east across the river and was trying to seize the two avenues of advance into <unk> above and below Lake U @-@ p <unk> . On August 31 , 1950 , Lake U @-@ p <unk> was a large body of water although in most places very shallow . 
 At dawn September 1 , <unk> at 2nd Division headquarters in <unk> @-@ <unk> , 7 miles ( 11 km ) east of <unk> on the <unk> road , felt his division was in the midst of a crisis . The massive North Korean attack had made deep <unk> everywhere in the division sector except in the north in the zone of the 38th Infantry . The <unk> 9th Division had effected major <unk> of the <unk> at two principal points against the US 9th Infantry ; the <unk> 2nd Division in the meantime had made three major <unk> against the US 23rd Infantry ; and the <unk> 10th Division had begun crossing more troops in the Hill <unk> area near <unk> 'ung in the US 38th Infantry sector . At 08 : 10 <unk> telephoned Eighth Army headquarters and reported the heaviest and deepest North Korean <unk> were in the 9th Infantry sector . 
 <unk> planes rose from the division strip every hour to observe the North Korean progress and to locate US 2nd Infantry Division front @-@ line units . Communication from division and regimental headquarters to nearly all the forward units was broken . Beginning at 09 : 30 and continuing throughout the rest of the day , the light aviation section of the division artillery located front @-@ line units cut off by the North Koreans , and made fourteen <unk> of ammunition , food , water , and medical supplies . As information slowly built up at division headquarters it became apparent that the North Koreans had punched a hole 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) wide and 8 miles ( 13 km ) deep in the middle of the division line and made less severe <unk> elsewhere . The front @-@ line battalions of the US 9th and 23rd Regiments were in various states of <unk> and some companies had virtually disappeared . <unk> hoped he could organize a defense along the <unk> @-@ <unk> road east of the <unk> River , and prevent North Korean access to the passes eastward leading to <unk> and Ch <unk> . 
 
 = = = Reinforcements = = = 
 
 At 09 : 00 Walker requested the US Air Force to make a maximum effort along the <unk> River from <unk> @-@ dong , just above the US 2nd Division boundary , southward and to a depth of 15 miles ( 24 km ) west of the river . He wanted the Air Force to isolate the battlefield and prevent further North Korean reinforcements and supplies from moving across the river in support of the North Korean spearhead units . The Far East Command requested the US Navy to join in the air effort , and the US Seventh Fleet turned back from its strikes in the <unk> <unk> @-@ Seoul area and <unk> southward at full steam toward the southern battle front . Walker came to the US 2nd Division front at 12 : 00 and ordered the division to hold at all costs . He had already ordered ground reinforcements to the <unk> area . 
 During the morning of 1 September , Walker weighed the news coming in from his southern front , <unk> in a decision as to which part of the front most needed his Pusan Perimeter reserves . Since midnight the <unk> I Corps had broken his Pusan Perimeter in two places @-@ the <unk> 2nd and 9th Divisions in the US 2nd Division sector , and the <unk> 7th Division and <unk> 6th Division in the US 25th Division sector , below the junction of the <unk> and <unk> Rivers . In the US 2nd Division sector North Korean troops were at the edge of <unk> , the gateway to the corridor leading 12 miles ( 19 km ) eastward to <unk> and the main Pusan @-@ <unk> railroad and highway . 
 Eighth Army had in reserve three <unk> infantry regiments and the 2 @-@ battalion British 27th Infantry Brigade which was not yet completely equipped and ready to be placed in line : The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade at <unk> , 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) northeast of <unk> , preparing for movement to the port of Pusan ; the US 27th Infantry Regiment of the 25th Division which had arrived at <unk> only the night before at 20 : 30 to relieve the 5th Regimental Combat Team , which was then to join the 24th Division in the <unk> area ; and the US 19th Infantry Regiment of the US 24th Infantry Division , then with that division 's headquarters at <unk> southeast of <unk> . Walker alerted both the 24th Division headquarters , together with its 19th Regiment , and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to move at a moment 's notice ; the 24th Division either to the 2nd or 25th Division fronts , and the marines to an <unk> destination . 
 As the morning passed , General Walker decided that the situation was most critical in the <unk> <unk> area of the US 2nd Division sector . There the North Koreans threatened <unk> and with it the entire Eighth Army position . At 11 : 00 Walker ordered US Marine Corps Brigadier General Edward A. Craig , commanding the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade , to prepare the marines to move at once . The marines made ready to depart for the <unk> <unk> at 13 : 30 .

 The situation on the front was chaotic during the day September 1 . The North Koreans at one place had crossed at the <unk> ferry , captured <unk> , and scattered A Company , 9th Infantry at its positions from <unk> northward . A Company withdrew to positions on the ridge line back of the river . From there at daylight the men could see North Korean soldiers on many of the ridges surrounding them , most of them moving east . After several hours , 2nd Platoon of A Company sent a patrol down the hill to <unk> to obtain supplies abandoned there during the night , returning later with much needed water , rations , and ammunition . 
 Later in the morning North Korean barges crossed the <unk> below A Company . The company sent a squad with a light machine gun to the southern tip of the ridge overlooking <unk> to take these troops under fire . When the squad reached the tip of the ridge they saw that a North Korean force occupied houses at its base . The company hit these houses with artillery . The North Koreans broke from the houses , running for the river . At this the light machine gun at the tip of the ridge took them under fire , as did another across the <unk> to the south in the US 25th Infantry Division sector . <unk> <unk> artillery fire decimated this group . Combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated 300 casualties on this North Korean force . In the afternoon , US aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company ; only part of it was recovered . The 1st Battalion ordered A Company to withdraw the company that night . 
 During the withdraw , however , A Company ran into a sizable North Korean force and had scattered in the ensuing fight . Most of the company , including its commander were killed at close range . In this desperate action , Private First Class Luther H. Story , a weapons squad leader , fought so <unk> that he was awarded the Medal of Honor . <unk> wounded , Story refused to be a burden to those who might escape , and when last seen was still engaging North Korean at close range . Of those in the company , approximately ten men escaped to friendly lines . The next morning , under heavy fog , the group made its way by <unk> toward <unk> . From a hill at 12 : 00 , after the fog had lifted , the men looked down on the Battle of <unk> which was then in progress . That afternoon 20 survivors of the company merged into the lines of the 72nd Tank Battalion near <unk> . <unk> from this position continued to stream in the next few days as well .

 In the meantime , Task Force <unk> was still holding its position along the <unk> River , about 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) north of where A Company had been destroyed on the southern end of the line . The perimeter position taken by the men of D and H Companies , 9th Infantry , who had started up the hill before the North Koreans struck , was on a southern <unk> of Hill <unk> , 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) south of B Company 's higher position . In addition to the D and H Company men , there were a few from the Heavy <unk> Platoon and one or two from B Company . <unk> , 60 to 70 men were in the group . The group had an <unk> @-@ 300 radio , a heavy machine gun , two light machine gun , a <unk> <unk> <unk> Rifle , about 20 <unk> <unk> rifles , and about 40 <unk> or pistols . <unk> assumed command of the group . 
 During the night <unk> established radio communication with the 1st Battalion , 9th infantry . When daylight came <unk> and his group saw that they were surrounded by North Koreans . One force occupied the higher <unk> half a mile above them , formerly held by B Company . Below them , North Koreans continued crossing the river and moving supplies forward to their combat units , some of them already several miles eastward . The North Koreans quickly discovered Task Force <unk> group . They first attacked it at 14 : 00 that afternoon , and were repulsed . That night an estimated company attacked three times , pressing the fight to close quarters , but failed each time to penetrate the tight US perimeter . <unk> of the second day disclosed many North Korean dead on the steep slopes outside the perimeter . 
 In the afternoon of September 2 <unk> <unk> 1st Battalion for an <unk> of supplies . A US plane attempted the drop , but the perimeter was so small and the slopes so steep that virtually all the supplies went into North Korean hands . The men in the perimeter did , however , recover from a drop made later at 19 : 00 some supplies and ammunition . Private First Class Joseph R. <unk> , of H Company , left the perimeter to gather weapons , ammunition , and grenades from the North Korean dead . On several occasions he was attacked , and on one such occasion a North Korean soldier suddenly attacked <unk> , who killed the North Korean in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat . 
 That same afternoon , the North Koreans sent an American prisoner up the hill to <unk> with the message , " You have one hour to surrender or be blown to pieces . " <unk> in frontal infantry attack to reduce the little defending force , the North Koreans now meant to take it under mortar fire . Only 45 minutes later North Korean <unk> fire came in on the <unk> and two machine guns from positions northward and higher on the slope of Hill <unk> swept the perimeter . Soon , mortars <unk> on a neighboring high finger ridge eastward registered on <unk> 's perimeter and continued firing until dark . The machine gun fire forced every man to stay in his <unk> . The lifting of the mortar fire after dark was the signal for renewed North Korean infantry attacks , all of which were repulsed . But the number of killed and wounded within the perimeter was growing , and supplies were diminishing . There were no medical supplies except those carried by one aid man . 
 The third day , September 3 , the situation worsened . The weather was hot and ammunition , food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted . Since the previous afternoon , North Korean mortar <unk> had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter . <unk> later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed . Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself . Dead and dying US troops were in almost every <unk> . <unk> fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units . Artillery fire and air strikes requested by <unk> never came . Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and threw grenades into it . Six times <unk> <unk> from his <unk> to escape grenades thrown into it . In this close action <unk> was killed . Most of the <unk> of the perimeter received one or more direct mortar hits in the course of the continuing mortar fire . One of these killed <unk> on September 3 . The command passed now to First Lieutenant Raymond J. <unk> of D Company , senior surviving officer . 
 At daylight on the morning of 4 September only two officers and approximately half the men who had assembled on the hill , were alive . As the day passed , with ammunition down to about one clip per man and only a few grenades left and no help in sight , <unk> decided to abandon the position that night . When it got dark the survivors would split into small groups and try to get back to friendly lines . That evening after dark the North Koreans launched another weak attack against the position . At 22 : 00 , <unk> and Caldwell and 27 enlisted men slipped off the hill in groups of four . Master Sergeant Travis E. Watkins , still alive in his <unk> condition , refused efforts of evacuation , saying that he did not want to be a burden to those who had a chance to get away . He asked only that his <unk> be loaded and placed on his chest with the muzzle under his chin . Like <unk> , he would also win the Medal of Honor for his actions . Of the 29 men who came off the hill the night of September 4 , 22 escaped to friendly lines , many of them following the <unk> downstream , hiding by day and traveling by night , until they reached the lines of the US 25th Infantry Division . 
 Members of Task Force <unk> who escaped from Hill <unk> brought back considerable intelligence information of North Korean activity in the vicinity of the <unk> ferry crossing site . At the ferry site the North Koreans had put in an underwater bridge . A short distance downstream , each night they placed a <unk> bridge across the river and took it up before dawn the next morning . <unk> parties of 50 civilians guarded by four North Korean soldiers crossed the river continuously at night , an estimated total of 800 @-@ 1 @,@ 000 carriers being used at this crossing site .

 North of the US 9th Infantry and the battles in the <unk> <unk> and around <unk> , the US <unk> Infantry Regiment after daylight of September 1 was in a very precarious position . Its 1st Battalion had been driven from the river positions and isolated 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) westward . Approximately 400 North Koreans now overran the regimental command post , compelling Freeman to withdraw it about 600 yards ( 550 m ) . There , 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) northwest of <unk> , the US 23rd Infantry Headquarters and Headquarters Company , <unk> regimental units , and regimental staff officers checked the North Koreans in a 3 @-@ hour fight . 
 The North Koreans advanced to <unk> itself during the afternoon of September 2 , and ROK National Police withdrew from the town . North Koreans were in <unk> that evening . With his communications broken southward to the 2nd Infantry Division headquarters and the 9th Infantry , Haynes during the day decided to send a tank patrol down the <unk> road in an effort to re @-@ establish communication . C Company , 72nd Tank Battalion , led its tanks southward . They had to fight their way down the road through several roadblocks . Of the three tanks that started , only the lead tank got through to <unk> . There , it delivered an <unk> of Task Force Haynes ' positions to Bradley . 
 Still farther northward in the zone of the US 38th Infantry the North Koreans were also active . After the North Korean breakthrough during the night of August 31 , <unk> had ordered the 2nd Battalion , 38th Infantry , to move south and help the 23rd Infantry establish a defensive position west of <unk> . In attempting to do this , the battalion found North Korean troops already on the ridges along the road . They had penetrated to Hill <unk> overlooking the 38th Infantry command post . This hill and Hill <unk> dominated the rear areas of the regiment . At 06 : 00 September 3 , 300 North Koreans launched an attack from Hill <unk> against the 38th Regiment command post . The regimental commander organized a defensive perimeter and requested a bombing strike which was denied him because the enemy target and his defense perimeter were too close to each other . But the Air Force did deliver rocket and <unk> strikes . 
 This fight continued until September 5 . On that day F Company captured Hill <unk> killing 150 North Koreans . From the crest he and his men watched as many more North Koreans ran into a village below them . Directed artillery fire destroyed the village . Among the abandoned North Korean materiel on the hill , <unk> 's men found twenty @-@ five American <unk> and <unk> guns , a large American radio , thirty boxes of <unk> American fragmentation and concussion grenades , and some American rations .

 Meanwhile , during these actions in its rear , the 1st Battalion , 23rd Infantry , was cut off 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) west of the nearest friendly units . On September 1 the regiment ordered it to withdraw to the <unk> area . At 14 : 00 a tank @-@ infantry patrol was sent down the road , but it reported that an estimated North Korean battalion held the mountain pass just eastward of the battalion 's defense perimeter . Upon receiving this report the battalion commander requested permission by radio to remain in his present position and try to obstruct the movement of North Korean reinforcements and supplies . That evening Freeman approved this request , and 1st Battalion spent three days in the isolated positions . During this time C @-@ 47 <unk> planes supplied the battalion by <unk> . 
 On the morning of September 1 , 3rd Battalion , 38th Infantry moved in an attack westward from the 23rd Regiment command post near <unk> @-@ <unk> to open the road to the 1st Battalion . On the second day of the fighting at the pass , the relief force broke through the roadblock with the help of air strikes and artillery and tank fire . The advanced elements of the battalion joined 1st Battalion at 17 : 00 September 2 . That evening , North Koreans strongly attacked the 3rd Battalion , 38th Infantry , on Hill <unk> north of the road and opposite 1st Battalion , driving one company from its position . 
 On September 4 , Haynes changed the boundary between the 38th and 23rd Infantry Regiments , giving the northern part of the 23rd 's sector to the 38th Infantry , thus releasing 1st Battalion for movement southward to help the 2nd Battalion defend the southern approach to <unk> . The 1st Battalion , 23rd Infantry , about 1 @,@ 100 men strong when the attack began , was now down to a strength of approximately 600 men . The 23rd Infantry now made plans to concentrate all its troops on the position held by its 2nd Battalion on the <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> road . The 1st Battalion moved there and took a place on the left flank of the 2nd Battalion . At the same time the regimental command post moved to the rear of this position . In this regimental perimeter , the 23rd Infantry fought a series of hard battles . Simultaneously it had to send combat patrols to its rear to clear infiltrating North Koreans from <unk> and from its supply road .

 On the morning of September 1 the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the <unk> 9th Division , in their first offensive of the war , stood only a few miles short of <unk> after a successful river crossing and penetration of the American line . The 3rd Regiment had been left at <unk> <unk> , but division commander Major General <unk> <unk> Sam felt the chances of capturing <unk> were strong . 
 On the morning of September 1 , with only the shattered remnants of E Company at hand , the US 9th Infantry Regiment , US 2nd Infantry Division had virtually no troops to defend <unk> . <unk> in this emergency attached the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion to the regiment . The US 72nd Tank Battalion and the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company also were assigned positions close to <unk> . The regimental commander planned to place the engineers on the chain of low hills that arched around <unk> on the northwest . 
 A Company , 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , moved to the south side of the <unk> @-@ <unk> River road ; D Company of the 2nd Engineer Battalion was on the north side of the road . Approximately 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of <unk> an estimated 300 North Korean troops engaged A Company in a fire fight . <unk> Gun Motor <unk> of the 82nd AAA Battalion supported the engineers in this action , which lasted several hours . Meanwhile , with the approval of General Bradley , D Company moved to the hill immediately south of and overlooking <unk> . A platoon of infantry went into position behind it . A Company was now ordered to fall back to the southeast edge of <unk> on the left flank of D Company . There , A Company went into position along the road ; on its left was C Company of the Engineer battalion , and beyond C Company was the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company . The hill occupied by D Company was in reality the western tip of a large mountain mass that lay southeast of the town . The road to <unk> came south out of <unk> , bent around the western tip of this mountain , and then ran eastward along its southern base . In its position , D Company not only commanded the town but also its exit , the road to <unk> . 
 North Koreans had also approached <unk> from the south . The US 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company and tanks of the 72nd Tank Battalion opposed them in a sharp fight . In this action , Sergeant First Class Charles W. Turner of the Reconnaissance Company particularly distinguished himself . He mounted a tank , operated its exposed turret machine gun , and directed tank fire which reportedly destroyed seven North Korean machine guns . Turner and this tank came under heavy North Korean fire which shot away the tank 's <unk> and <unk> and scored more than 50 hits on it . Turner , although wounded , remained on the tank until he was killed . That night North Korean soldiers crossed the low ground around <unk> and entered the town from the south . 
 At 09 : 35 September 2 , while the North Koreans were attempting to destroy the engineer troops at the southern edge of <unk> and clear the road to <unk> , Walker spoke by telephone with Major General Doyle O. <unk> , Deputy Chief of Staff , Far East Command in Tokyo . He described the situation around the Perimeter and said the most serious threat was along the boundary between the US 2nd and US 25th Infantry Divisions . He described the location of his reserve forces and his plans for using them . He said he had started the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade toward <unk> but had not yet released them for commitment there and he wanted to be sure that General of the Army Douglas MacArthur approved his use of them , since he knew that this would interfere with other plans of the Far East Command . Walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd Division lines without using them . <unk> replied that MacArthur had the day before approved the use of the US Marines if and when Walker considered it necessary . A few hours after this conversation Walker , at 13 : 15 , attached the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the US 2nd Division and ordered a co @-@ ordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the marines , with the mission of destroying the North Koreans east of the <unk> River in the 2nd Division sector and of restoring the river line . The marines were to be released from 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was accomplished . 
 A decision was reached that the marines would attack west at 08 : 00 on September 3 <unk> the <unk> @-@ <unk> River road ; the 9th Infantry , B Company of the 72nd Tank Battalion , and D Battery of the <unk> AAA Battalion would attack northwest above the marines and attempt to re @-@ establish contact with the US 23rd Infantry ; the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , remnants of the 1st Battalion , 9th Infantry , and elements of the 72nd Tank Battalion would attack on the left flank , or south , of the marines to reestablish contact with the 25th Division . Eighth Army now ordered the US 24th Infantry Division headquarters and the US 19th Infantry Regiment to move to the Susan @-@ <unk> area , 8 miles ( 13 km ) south of <unk> and 15 miles ( 24 km ) east of the confluence of the <unk> River and the <unk> River . There it was to prepare to enter the battle in either the 2nd or 25th Division zone . 
 The American counteroffensive of September 3 – 5 west of <unk> , according to prisoner statements , resulted in one of the <unk> <unk> of the war for a North Korean division . Even though remnants of the <unk> 9th Division , supported by the low strength <unk> 4th Division , still held <unk> @-@ <unk> Ridge , <unk> Hill , and the intervening ground back to the <unk> on September 6 , the division 's offensive strength had been spent at the end of the American counterattack . The <unk> 9th and 4th divisions were not able to resume the offensive . 
 
 = = = <unk> 2nd Division destroyed = = = 
 
 The <unk> 2nd Division made a new effort against the 23rd Infantry 's perimeter in the <unk> hours of September 8 , in an attempt to break through eastward . This attack , launched at 02 : 30 and heavily supported with artillery , penetrated F Company . It was apparent that unless F Company 's position could be restored the entire regimental front would collapse . When all its officers became casualties , First Lieutenant Ralph R. Robinson , adjutant of the 2nd Battalion , assumed command of the company . With North Koreans rapidly infiltrating his company 's position and gaining its rear , Robinson in the darkness made his way through them 500 yards ( 460 m ) to A Company 's position . There he obtained that company 's reserve platoon and brought it back to F Company . He accomplished the dangerous and difficult task of <unk> it into the gap in F Company 's lines in darkness and heavy rain . 
 The attack tapered off with the coming of daylight , but that night it resumed . The North Koreans struck repeatedly at the defense line . This time they continued the fighting into the daylight hours of 9 September . The Air Force then concentrated strong air support over the regimental perimeter to aid the ground troops . Casualties came to the aid stations from the infantry companies in an almost steady stream during the morning . All available men from Headquarters Company and special units were formed into squads and put into the fight at the most critical points . At one time , the regimental reserve was down to six men . When the attack finally ceased shortly after 12 : 00 the 23rd Regiment had an estimated combat efficiency of only 38 percent . 
 This heavy night and day battle cost the <unk> 2nd Division most of its remaining offensive strength . The medical officer of the <unk> 17th Regiment , 2nd Division , captured a few days later , said that the division evacuated about 300 men nightly to a hospital in <unk> @-@ <unk> , and that in the first two weeks of September the 2nd Division lost 1 @,@ 300 killed and 2 @,@ 500 wounded in the fighting west of <unk> . Even though its offensive strength was largely spent by September 9 , the division continued to harass rear areas around <unk> with infiltrating groups as large as companies . <unk> daily had to open the main supply road and clear the town . 
 North Korean and US troops remained locked in combat along the <unk> River for several more days . The North Koreans ' offensive capability was largely destroyed , and the US troops resolved to hold their lines barring further attack . 
 
 = = = North Korean withdrawal = = = 
 
 The UN counterattack at <unk> collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes . On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night , and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them . Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea . The North Koreans withdrew from the <unk> area first , the night of September 18 – 19 . After the forces there , the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North . The US units rapidly pursued them north , passing over the <unk> River positions , which were no longer of strategic importance . 
 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 
 The North Korean 2nd and 9th Divisions were almost completely destroyed in the battles . The 9th Division had numbered 9 @,@ 350 men at the beginning of the offensive on September 1 . The 2nd Division numbered 6 @,@ 000 . Only a few hundred from each division returned to North Korea after the fight . The majority of the North Korean troops had been killed , captured or deserted . All of <unk> II Corps was in a similar state , and the North Korean army , exhausted at Pusan Perimeter and cut off after <unk> , was on the brink of defeat . 
 By this time , the US 2nd Infantry Division suffered 1 @,@ 120 killed , 2 @,@ <unk> wounded , 67 captured and 69 missing during its time at Pusan Perimeter . This included about 180 casualties it suffered during the First Battle of <unk> <unk> the previous month . American forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the North Koreans from breaking the Pusan Perimeter . The division had numbered 17 @,@ <unk> on September 1 , but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties . The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade suffered 185 killed and around 500 wounded during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter , most of which probably occurred at <unk> . 
 Of all the North Korean attacks along the Pusan Perimeter , the Second Battle of <unk> <unk> is seen by historians as the most serious threat . It was the battle in which the North Koreans made the most substantial gains , splitting the US 2nd Infantry Division in half and briefly capturing <unk> , where they were very close to breaching through to the US forces ' supply lines and threatening other divisions ' rear areas . However , once again the fatal weakness of the North Korean Army had cost it victory after an impressive initial success — its communications and supply were not capable of <unk> a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack in the face of massive air , armor , and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points . By September 8 , the North Korean attacks in the area had been repulsed .
